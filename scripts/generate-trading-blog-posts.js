      <h2>The #1 Reason Traders Fail (And How to Fix It)</h2>
      <p>95% of traders fail not because of bad strategy, but because of poor psychology. Your mind is either your greatest asset or your worst enemy.</p>

      <h3>The Big 3 Psychological Traps</h3>
      <h4>1. Fear of Missing Out (FOMO)</h4>
      <p>FOMO causes you to chase entries after the move has already happened. Solution: Wait for your setup, stick to your plan, and remember there's always another trade.</p>

      <h4>2. Revenge Trading</h4>
      <p>After a loss, you immediately take another trade to "get your money back." This is gambling, not trading. Solution: Take a 30-minute break after every loss.</p>

      <h4>3. Fear of Pulling the Trigger</h4>
      <p>You see your setup but can't execute because you fear losing money. Solution: Trade smaller size until confidence builds naturally.</p>

      <h3>The Professional Trader Mindset</h3>
      <p>Professional traders view trading as probability, not certainty. They know each trade is independent and focus on process over outcomes.</p>

      <h3>Daily Mental Routine</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Morning: Review your trading plan and rules</li>
        <li>Pre-market: Visualize executing your strategy perfectly</li>
        <li>During trading: Focus on process, not P&L</li>
        <li>Post-market: Journal what you did well mentally</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Handling Losing Streaks</h3>
      <p>Even the best systems have losing streaks. Reduce size by 50% after 3 consecutive losses. This protects capital and rebuilds confidence.</p>

      <h3>The Power of Journaling</h3>
      <p>Write down your emotional state before, during, and after each trade. Patterns will emerge showing when you trade best and when to stay away.</p>

      <h2>RSI Indicator: The Complete Trading Guide</h2>
      <p>The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is one of the most powerful momentum oscillators in trading. Here's how to use it profitably.</p>

      <h3>What is RSI?</h3>
      <p>RSI measures the magnitude of recent price changes to evaluate overbought or oversold conditions. It oscillates between 0 and 100.</p>

      <h3>Basic RSI Signals</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>RSI > 70: Overbought (potential sell signal)</li>
        <li>RSI < 30: Oversold (potential buy signal)</li>
        <li>RSI = 50: Neutral momentum</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>RSI Divergence Strategy</h3>
      <h4>Bullish Divergence</h4>
      <p>Price makes lower lows while RSI makes higher lows. This signals weakening downside momentum and potential reversal.</p>

      <h4>Bearish Divergence</h4>
      <p>Price makes higher highs while RSI makes lower highs. This indicates weakening upside momentum and possible reversal.</p>

      <h3>RSI in Trending Markets</h3>
      <p>In strong uptrends, RSI can stay overbought (>70) for extended periods. Use RSI dips to 50 as buy opportunities instead.</p>

      <h3>Advanced RSI Techniques</h3>
      <h4>RSI Trendlines</h4>
      <p>Draw trendlines on RSI itself. Breaks of these trendlines often precede price reversals.</p>

      <h4>RSI with Support/Resistance</h4>
      <p>Combine RSI signals with key price levels for higher probability setups.</p>

      <h3>Optimal RSI Settings</h3>
      <p>Default 14-period works well for most timeframes. Day traders may use 9-period for faster signals. Swing traders can use 21-period for smoother readings.</p>

      <h3>Common RSI Mistakes</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Shorting just because RSI > 70 in a strong uptrend</li>
        <li>Ignoring price action and relying solely on RSI</li>
        <li>Not waiting for confirmation before entering</li>
      </ul>

    content: `
      <h2>MACD Indicator: From Basics to Profitable Trading</h2>
      <p>MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages.</p>

      <h3>Understanding MACD Components</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>MACD Line: 12 EMA - 26 EMA</li>
        <li>Signal Line: 9 EMA of MACD line</li>
        <li>Histogram: MACD line - Signal line</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>MACD Crossover Strategy</h3>
      <h4>Bullish Crossover</h4>
      <p>MACD line crosses above signal line = Buy signal. Strongest when crossing from below zero line.</p>

      <h4>Bearish Crossover</h4>
      <p>MACD line crosses below signal line = Sell signal. Strongest when crossing from above zero line.</p>

      <h3>MACD Histogram Trading</h3>
      <p>Growing histogram = strengthening trend. Shrinking histogram = weakening momentum, potential reversal ahead.</p>

      <h3>MACD Divergence Patterns</h3>
      <h4>Regular Divergence</h4>
      <p>Price and MACD moving in opposite directions signals potential trend reversal. Wait for MACD crossover confirmation.</p>

      <h4>Hidden Divergence</h4>
      <p>Signals trend continuation. Less reliable than regular divergence but useful for re-entries.</p>

      <h3>MACD Zero Line Strategy</h3>
      <p>MACD crossing above zero = bullish momentum building. MACD crossing below zero = bearish momentum building.</p>

      <h3>Best Timeframes for MACD</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Day Trading: 5-min, 15-min charts</li>
        <li>Swing Trading: 1-hour, 4-hour charts</li>
        <li>Position Trading: Daily, weekly charts</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>MACD + Price Action</h3>
      <p>Combine MACD signals with support/resistance, trendlines, and candlestick patterns for higher win rates.</p>

      <h3>Avoiding MACD Whipsaws</h3>
      <p>MACD lags price action. Use it for confirmation, not primary entry signals. Best in trending markets, avoid in choppy conditions.</p>

      <h2>Futures Trading 101: Everything Beginners Need to Know</h2>
      <p>Futures trading offers leverage, liquidity, and 24-hour markets. This guide covers everything you need to start trading futures successfully.</p>

      <h3>What Are Futures Contracts?</h3>
      <p>Futures are standardized contracts to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price on a specific date. You don't own the underlying asset - you're speculating on price movement.</p>

      <h3>Popular Futures Markets</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>ES (E-mini S&P 500): $50/point, most liquid</li>
        <li>NQ (E-mini Nasdaq): $20/point, tech-heavy</li>
        <li>YM (E-mini Dow): $5/point, industrial focus</li>
        <li>CL (Crude Oil): $1,000/point, volatile energy market</li>
        <li>GC (Gold): $100/point, safe-haven asset</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Understanding Margin Requirements</h3>
      <p>Futures use initial margin (to open position) and maintenance margin (to keep position open). ES requires $12,650 initial margin, $11,500 maintenance.</p>

      <h3>Tick Size & Tick Value</h3>
      <p>ES tick = 0.25 points = $12.50. If ES moves from 4500.00 to 4500.25, that's $12.50 per contract profit/loss.</p>

      <h3>Trading Sessions</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Pre-market: 6 PM - 9:30 AM ET</li>
        <li>Regular Session: 9:30 AM - 4:00 PM ET</li>
        <li>After Hours: 4:00 PM - 6:00 PM ET</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Risk Management Essentials</h3>
      <p>Never risk more than 1-2% of your account per trade. Use stop losses ALWAYS. Start with micro futures (MES, MNQ) that are 1/10th the size.</p>

      <h3>Beginner Strategy: Opening Range Breakout</h3>
      <p>Mark the high/low of the first 30 minutes. Buy breakout above high, short breakout below low. Simple and effective.</p>

      <h3>Common Beginner Mistakes</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Trading full ES contract with small account (use MES instead)</li>
        <li>No stop loss or stop too wide</li>
        <li>Trading overnight news without experience</li>
        <li>Overtrading during low-volume periods</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Next Steps</h3>
      <p>Open a sim account with a futures broker. Practice for 3 months or until you're consistently profitable. Then start with 1 micro contract.</p>

      <h2>ES Futures: The Ultimate Trading Guide</h2>
      <p>The E-mini S&P 500 (ES) is the most liquid futures contract in the world. Here's how professionals trade it.</p>

      <h3>Why Trade ES?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Extreme liquidity = tight spreads (0.25 tick)</li>
        <li>Trades 23 hours/day, 5 days/week</li>
        <li>Clear technical patterns due to institutional flow</li>
        <li>$50 per point = manageable risk/reward</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Key ES Trading Sessions</h3>
      <h4>London Open (3 AM ET)</h4>
      <p>European money flows in. Watch for breakouts from overnight range.</p>

      <h4>New York Open (9:30 AM ET)</h4>
      <p>Highest volume period. First 30 minutes set the tone for the day.</p>

      <h4>Power Hour (3:00-4:00 PM ET)</h4>
      <p>Institutional rebalancing creates strong directional moves.</p>

      <h3>Professional ES Strategies</h3>

      <h4>1. Opening Range Breakout</h4>
      <p>Mark 9:30-10:00 AM range. Trade breakout with clear stops at opposite extreme.</p>

      <h4>2. VWAP Reversion</h4>
      <p>When ES extends 2+ standard deviations from VWAP, expect reversion. Enter on first pullback sign.</p>

      <h4>3. Market Profile Value Area</h4>
      <p>Price tends to revert to previous day's value area. Trade rejections from value area extremes.</p>

      <h4>4. Order Flow Imbalance</h4>
      <p>Watch for absorption at key levels. When buying pressure can't push through, expect reversal.</p>

      <h3>ES Risk Management</h3>
      <p>Full ES contract = $50/point. With $25K account, risk max $250/trade = 5 point stop. Start with MES (1/10th size) to learn.</p>

      <h3>Volume Profile Analysis</h3>
      <p>High volume nodes act as magnets - price tends to revisit. Low volume nodes accelerate price movement.</p>

      <h3>Best Time to Trade ES</h3>
      <p>Avoid overnight session unless trading news. Best setups happen 9:30-11:30 AM and 2:30-4:00 PM ET.</p>

      <h3>Tools & Platforms</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>NinjaTrader: Best for order flow/footprint charts</li>
        <li>TradingView: Clean charting with replay mode</li>
        <li>Sierra Chart: Advanced volume profile tools</li>
