# Blog Schema Automation System

Automated bulk implementation system for BlogPosting schema markup across blog posts.

## Overview

This automation system was created during Phase 3 of the blog schema implementation project. It successfully processed 100 high-priority blog posts in 2 seconds with 0% error rate.

### Key Features

- Automated schema generation and injection
- Intelligent prioritization algorithm
- Comprehensive backup system
- Full rollback capability
- Detailed reporting and validation
- Zero manual intervention required

## Scripts

### 1. bulk-add-schema.js

**Purpose:** Automated bulk schema implementation

**Features:**
- Scans all blog posts automatically
- Identifies posts without existing schema
- Prioritizes by traffic keywords, content quality, links, and recency
- Generates and injects BlogPosting schema
- Creates backups before modification
- Validates TypeScript syntax
- Generates detailed reports

**Usage:**

```bash
# Dry run (test without making changes)
node scripts/bulk-add-schema.js --dry-run --limit=10

# Live run with limit
node scripts/bulk-add-schema.js --limit=100

# Process all posts without schema
node scripts/bulk-add-schema.js --limit=999
```

**Arguments:**
- `--dry-run` - Test mode, creates backups but doesn't modify files
- `--limit=N` - Maximum number of posts to process (default: 100)

**Output:**
- `SCHEMA_PHASE3_SUMMARY.txt` - Quick statistics
- `docs/SCHEMA_PHASE3_REPORT.md` - Detailed report
- `.schema-backups/*.backup` - Backup files

### 2. rollback-schema.js

**Purpose:** Restore blog posts from backups

**Features:**
- Lists all available backups
- Verifies backup file integrity
- Restores individual posts
- Bulk restoration with confirmation
- Creates safety backups before rollback
- Detailed restoration reporting

**Usage:**

```bash
# List all available backups
node scripts/rollback-schema.js

# Verify backup integrity
node scripts/rollback-schema.js --verify

# Restore single post
node scripts/rollback-schema.js ai-automation-guide

# Restore all posts (requires --confirm)
node scripts/rollback-schema.js --all --confirm
```

**Safety Features:**
- Verification before restoration
- Safety backup of current state
- Confirmation required for bulk operations
- Detailed error reporting

## Prioritization Algorithm

Posts are scored based on multiple factors:

### High-Priority Keywords (+10 points each)
- AI, automation, n8n, ChatGPT, ComfyUI, Claude, GPT
- Machine learning, neural networks, workflow automation
- Instagram, monetization, revenue, courses, training

### Content Quality (+8-15 points)
- Optimal length: 300-500 lines (+15 points)
- Medium length: 200-300 lines (+10 points)
- Long content: 500-800 lines (+8 points)

### Internal Linking (+10-20 points)
- 3+ internal links (+20 points)
- 1-2 internal links (+10 points)

### Recency (+15 points)
- Modified within last 6 months

**Example Scoring:**
```
Post: ai-agent-development-course
- Keywords: ai (10), agent (10), course (10) = 30
- Content: 446 lines = 15
- Links: 0 = 0
- Recent: Yes = 15
- Total: 70 points
```

## Schema Implementation

Each post receives the following additions:

### 1. Import Statement
```typescript
import { generateBlogPostSchema } from '@/lib/blog-schema'
```

### 2. Schema Generation
```typescript
const schema = generateBlogPostSchema({
  title: metadata.title,
  description: metadata.description,
  slug: "post-slug",
  publishedTime: metadata.openGraph.publishedTime,
  modifiedTime: metadata.openGraph.modifiedTime,
  category: metadata.category || "Technology",
  keywords: metadata.keywords || [],
  image: metadata.openGraph.images[0].url
})
```

### 3. Schema Injection
```tsx
<script
  type="application/ld+json"
  dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: JSON.stringify(schema) }}
/>
```

## Schema Structure

The generated schema includes:

### BlogPosting
- Headline and description
- Publication and modification dates
- Author information with social links
- Publisher organization data
- Article image and metadata
- Keywords and categorization
- Word count and reading time (if available)

### BreadcrumbList
- Home → Blog → Post navigation

### WebSite
- Site information
- Search action capability

## Backup System

### Backup Location
```
.schema-backups/
├── ai-agent-development-course.backup
├── ai-automation-guide.backup
└── [post-slug].backup
```

### Backup Verification

The system verifies:
- File exists and is readable
- Contains valid metadata export
- Contains default export function
- Does NOT contain schema (confirming it's pre-implementation)
- Valid TypeScript/React structure

### Rollback Process

1. Verify backup integrity
2. Create safety backup of current state
3. Restore from backup file
4. Report success/failure

## Validation

### Automated Checks
- TypeScript compilation (`npx tsc --noEmit`)
- Import statement verification
- Schema generation code presence
- Slug parameter accuracy
- Script tag formatting
- Metadata field references

### Manual Validation
```bash
# Test with Google Rich Results Test
# Visit: https://search.google.com/test/rich-results

# Validate with schema.org
# Visit: https://validator.schema.org/
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue: "Cannot find metadata export"**
- Cause: Post doesn't have proper metadata structure
- Solution: Post is skipped automatically, check error report

**Issue: TypeScript compilation errors**
- Cause: Syntax issues in post file
- Solution: Review error output, rollback if needed

**Issue: Backup verification failed**
- Cause: Corrupted backup file
- Solution: Re-run with that post excluded

### Error Recovery

```bash
# List failed posts
grep "Error:" SCHEMA_PHASE3_REPORT.md

# Rollback specific post
node scripts/rollback-schema.js [slug]

# Verify all backups
node scripts/rollback-schema.js --verify
```

## Best Practices

### Before Running

1. Commit current changes to git
2. Run dry-run first: `--dry-run --limit=5`
3. Verify backups are created
4. Check sample output

### During Execution

1. Monitor console output
2. Watch for error messages
3. Check backup creation
4. Verify processing speed

### After Execution

1. Review generated reports
2. Run TypeScript validation
3. Test sample posts in browser
4. Verify schema with validators
5. Monitor Search Console

## Phase 4 Planning

### Remaining Work
- 392 posts without schema
- Target: 100% coverage (546 posts)
- Timeline: 2-3 weeks

### Execution Strategy

```bash
# Batch 1: Next 100 high-priority
node scripts/bulk-add-schema.js --limit=100

# Batch 2: Next 100 medium-priority
node scripts/bulk-add-schema.js --limit=100

# Batch 3: Next 100 lower-priority
node scripts/bulk-add-schema.js --limit=100

# Batch 4: Final 92 posts
node scripts/bulk-add-schema.js --limit=92
```

### Estimated Results
