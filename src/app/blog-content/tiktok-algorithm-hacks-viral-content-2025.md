**Q: What's the most important factor for TikTok growth?**
A: Watch time and completion rate are the most critical factors. Creating content that people watch completely (and re-watch) is more important than any other metric.

**Q: Should I follow every trend to grow on TikTok?**
A: No, be selective. Participate in trends that align with your niche and add unique value. Creating original content that starts trends is often more effective than following every trend.
