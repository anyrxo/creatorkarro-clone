cd was-node-suite-comfyui
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Restart ComfyUI
```

## Workflow Optimization and Performance

### Memory Optimization

**Reducing VRAM Usage:**
```python
# Launch arguments for low VRAM systems
python main.py --lowvram --force-fp16

# For systems with <4GB VRAM
python main.py --novram --cpu

# Enable model offloading
python main.py --normalvram
```

**Batch Processing Optimization:**
- Process multiple images in single workflow
- Use consistent settings for efficiency
- Queue multiple prompts for overnight processing

### Quality Settings Guide

**Speed vs Quality Tradeoffs:**
```
Fast (10-15 seconds):
- Steps: 15-20
- Resolution: 512x512
- Sampler: euler_a

Balanced (30-45 seconds):
- Steps: 25-30  
- Resolution: 768x768
- Sampler: dpmpp_2m

High Quality (60-120 seconds):
- Steps: 35-50
- Resolution: 1024x1024+
- Sampler: dpmpp_2m_karras
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Installation Problems

**Issue: "CUDA out of memory" Error**
```bash
# Solutions in order of preference:
1. Add --lowvram flag
2. Reduce batch size to 1
3. Lower resolution (512x512)
4. Add --force-fp16 flag
5. Use --cpu flag as last resort
```

**Issue: "Module not found" Errors**
```bash
# Ensure virtual environment is activated
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows

# Reinstall requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt --force-reinstall
```

**Issue: Models Not Loading**
1. Verify model files are in correct directories
2. Check file permissions (Linux/Mac)
3. Ensure models aren't corrupted (re-download if necessary)
4. Restart ComfyUI after adding new models

### Performance Issues

**Slow Generation Speed:**
- Update GPU drivers to latest version
- Close unnecessary applications
- Enable GPU acceleration in system settings
- Check CPU temperature and throttling

**Interface Lag:**
