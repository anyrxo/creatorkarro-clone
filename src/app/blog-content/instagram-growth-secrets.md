## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How long does it take to see significant growth on Instagram?**

A: Use a mix of high, medium, and low-volume hashtags (maximum 30), focusing on relevance over popularity. Research community hashtags in your niche for better engagement.

A: Provide consistent value, build trust through authentic content, use clear calls-to-action, and direct traffic to email lists or landing pages optimized for conversion.
