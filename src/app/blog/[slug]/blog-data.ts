      <p>From 0 to 500K followers in 10 months. Here's everything I learned about Instagram growth, content strategy, and building a real business from social media.</p>
      
      <h2>The Journey</h2>
      <p>10 months ago, I had 127 followers (mostly friends and family). Today, over 500,000 people follow my content. Here's the real story - no fluff, no BS.</p>
      
      <h2>Key Lessons</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Consistency beats talent every single time</li>
        <li>Your first 100 posts will suck (that's normal)</li>
        <li>Engagement rate matters more than follower count</li>
        <li>Building an email list from day 1 was my smartest move</li>
        <li>Monetization should start at 10K, not 100K</li>
      </ul>

      <p>I've made every mistake in the book launching online businesses. Here are the 7 that cost me the most time, money, and sanity.</p>
      
      <h2>Mistake #1: Building Before Validating</h2>
      <p>Spent 6 months building a product nobody wanted. Always validate demand first.</p>
      
      <h2>Mistake #2: Trying to Do Everything Alone</h2>
      <p>Burned out trying to be the designer, developer, marketer, and salesperson. Build a team early.</p>

      <p>Want to hit $10K/month with digital products? Here's the exact 7-step blueprint I used.</p>

      <h2>Step 2: Build Your Audience</h2>
      <p>You need 1,000 true fans, not 100,000 followers. Focus on quality.</p>
