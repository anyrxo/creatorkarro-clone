      <h2>The #1 Reason Traders Fail (And How to Fix It)</h2>
      <p>95% of traders fail not because of bad strategy, but because of poor psychology. Your mind is either your greatest asset or your worst enemy.</p>

      <h3>The Big 3 Psychological Traps</h3>
      <h4>1. Fear of Missing Out (FOMO)</h4>
      <p>FOMO causes you to chase entries after the move has already happened. Solution: Wait for your setup, stick to your plan, and remember there's always another trade.</p>

      <h4>2. Revenge Trading</h4>
      <p>After a loss, you immediately take another trade to "get your money back." This is gambling, not trading. Solution: Take a 30-minute break after every loss.</p>

      <h4>3. Fear of Pulling the Trigger</h4>
      <p>You see your setup but can't execute because you fear losing money. Solution: Trade smaller size until confidence builds naturally.</p>

      <h3>The Professional Trader Mindset</h3>
      <p>Professional traders view trading as probability, not certainty. They know each trade is independent and focus on process over outcomes.</p>

      <h3>Daily Mental Routine</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Morning: Review your trading plan and rules</li>
        <li>Pre-market: Visualize executing your strategy perfectly</li>
        <li>During trading: Focus on process, not P&L</li>
        <li>Post-market: Journal what you did well mentally</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Handling Losing Streaks</h3>
      <p>Even the best systems have losing streaks. Reduce size by 50% after 3 consecutive losses. This protects capital and rebuilds confidence.</p>

      <h3>The Power of Journaling</h3>
      <p>Write down your emotional state before, during, and after each trade. Patterns will emerge showing when you trade best and when to stay away.</p>
