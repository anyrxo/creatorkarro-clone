**(Intro)**
"Welcome to Instagram Ignited. Before we talk about hashtags, cameras, or hooks, we need to talk about your brain.

Why do 99% of creators fail? It's not because they lack talent. It's not because they don't have a nice camera.
It's because they quit.

They post for 2 weeks, get 200 views, and say 'The algorithm hates me'.
No. The algorithm doesn't know you yet."

**(Slide: The 90-Day Rule)**
"I want you to sign a contract with yourself right now. It's called the **90-Day Rule**.
You are going to post one piece of content every single day for the next 90 days.

I don't care if it gets 0 views. I don't care if your mom is the only one watching.
You are building data points. You are training the algorithm on who you are.

If you can't commit to 90 days, close this course and get a refund. Seriously. This isn't a get-rich-quick scheme. It's a business."

**(Slide: Consistency vs Intensity)**
"Amateurs rely on Intensity. They get motivated at 2 AM, film 5 videos, post them all, and then burn out for a month.
Pros rely on Consistency.

I would rather you post one mediocre video every day than one perfect video once a month.
Volume negates luck. If you roll the dice enough times, you will hit sixes."

**(Slide: Your "Why" Statement)**
"When you are tired, when you have 0 views, what keeps you going?
'Making money' is not a strong enough reason. You need a 'Why'.

Is it to quit your 9-5? Is it to travel the world? Is it to retire your parents?
👉 **ACTION:** Write down your 'Why' on a piece of paper. Tape it to your monitor. You will need it."

Face the window. The light should hit your face.
This is soft, beautiful light. It's free. Use it."

You don't need a $500 Shure SM7B.
Just get close to your phone. The closer you are, the better you sound.
If you have $20, buy a wired lav mic from Amazon. It plugs into your shirt. Instant pro audio."

**(Slide: Camera Settings Checklist)**
"Before you film, do these 3 things:
1. **Wipe your lens.** Your shirt is fine. Grease makes footage look hazy.
2. **Shoot 4K at 30fps.** It looks cinematic. 60fps looks like a soap opera (unless you slow it down).
3. **Lock Exposure.** Tap and hold on your face until you see 'AE/AF Lock'. Now the brightness won't flicker."

👉 **ACTION:** Set up your filming spot. Record a 10-second test video. Watch it back. Is the audio clear? Is your face bright? If yes, you are ready to film."

"Welcome to Phase 2. This is arguably the most important lesson in the entire course. Why? Because if you can't stop the scroll, you don't exist.

We live in an attention economy. You are not competing with other creators in your niche. You are competing with Netflix, their best friend's text message, and a cat video. 

Today, I'm going to teach you the **Viral Hook Framework**. This is the exact system I used to gain 100k followers in 30 days."

**(Slide: The 3-Second Rule)**
"Here is the hard truth: You have exactly 3 seconds. Look at this retention graph. See that drop? That's where most people lose. 

If you don't hook them visually and verbally in those first 3 seconds, the algorithm assumes your content is trash and buries it.

So, how do we fix this?"

**(Slide: The Pattern Interrupt)**
"We use something called a **Pattern Interrupt**. 

When people scroll, they are in a trance. Your job is to snap them out of it. You can do this with:
1. **Movement**: Start the video in motion.
2. **Text**: A bold, controversial statement.
3. **Sound**: A sharp noise or unusual audio.

You need to create a 'Wait, what?' moment."

**(Slide: The Hook Generator Tool)**
"Now, I know writing hooks is hard. You stare at a blank page.

That's why I built the **Viral Hook Generator** for you.

👉 **ACTION:** Pause this video. Go to the Resources tab below and open the **Viral Hook Generator**.

I want you to select your niche, pick a 'Controversial' tone, and generate 5 hooks right now. 

Don't try to be creative yet. Just use the tool. It uses proven psychological frameworks like 'The Negative bias' and 'The Curiosity Gap'.

Go do that now."

It's not hashtags. It's not posting time.
It is **Shares**.

The algorithm sees a Share as the ultimate signal of quality.
If you want to go viral, you need to engineer your content to be shared."

**(Slide: The 3 Reasons People Share)**
"People only share for 3 reasons. Memorize these.
1. **Identity**: They share to say 'This is who I am'. If you make a video about 'Introvert Problems', every introvert shares it to say 'Yes, this is me!'.
2. **Utility**: They share to be helpful. 'Here is a list of free AI tools'. They send it to their work group chat.
3. **Status**: They share to look cool. 'Did you see this crazy news?'. They want to be the first to know."

**(Slide: The "Send This To" CTA)**

Instead, give a specific command.
'Send this to your friend who needs to hear this.'
'Share this with your gym buddy.'

Stop saying 'And then'.

Try it. It instantly makes your video look professional."

Most people just slap a song on it.

When text pops up? Add a 'Pop' sound.
When the scene changes? Add a 'Whoosh'.
When you reveal a secret? Add a 'Riser'.
These subtle sounds trigger dopamine. They keep the brain awake.

👉 **ACTION:** Open CapCut. Go to the 'Audio' tab. Explore the 'Effects' library. Add 3 sound effects to your next video."

**Velocity.**"

If 10 people like it in 1 minute, it shows it to 1,000.
If 100 people like it in 10 minutes, it shows it to 10,000.
It's a snowball. You need to push the snowball fast at the beginning."

**(Slide: Triggering the Algorithm)**
"How do we fake velocity?
1. **Reply fast.** When someone comments, reply immediately. Ask a question. 'Thanks! What did you think of tip #2?'. They reply back. Now you have 3 comments instead of 1.
2. **Share to Story.** As soon as you post, put it on your Story with a poll. 'Do you agree? Yes/No'. This drives traffic from your Story to your Reel.

You are lighting a match to start the fire.

👉 **ACTION:** Find 3 other creators in your niche. DM them. Ask to form a support group. 'I'll comment on yours if you comment on mine'. Do it."

If you have 8GB VRAM, you will crash.

"Follow this formula every time:
1. **Subject**: 'A 20 year old swedish woman'
2. **Action**: 'Walking down a busy street'
3. **Context**: 'Raining, neon lights, cyberpunk city'
4. **Style**: 'Raw photo, candid, 8k, masterpiece'
5. **Tech Specs**: 'Shot on Sony A7RIV, 85mm lens'

If you just type 'Woman', you get a generic woman.
If you type the formula, you get a person."

**(Slide: The "Token" System)**
"Order matters.
'A cat eating a pizza' is different from 'A pizza being eaten by a cat'.
Put the most important thing first.
If the AI ignores a word, wrap it in brackets like this: (blue hair:1.3).
This tells the AI: 'Pay 30% more attention to this'.

👉 **ACTION:** Open Flux. Generate 5 images using the formula. Change one variable (e.g., the lighting) and see how it changes the image."

Because it's too perfect.

Prompt for **Drama**.
'Rim light' creates a halo around the hair.
'Volumetric lighting' creates beams of light (fog).
'Chiaroscuro' creates deep shadows.
Shadows define the shape. Without shadows, she looks like a sticker."

**(Slide: Camera Imperfections)**
"A real camera has grain. It has blur.
AI generates a perfectly sharp image.
Add 'Film grain' to every prompt.
Add 'Motion blur' if she is moving.
Add 'Chromatic aberration' for a vintage look.
These tiny details tell the viewer's subconscious: 'This was taken with a lens, not a computer'."

You want pores. You want moles. You want sweat.
Use the prompt: 'Raw photo, unedited, skin texture, pores'.

You usually just need the 'Endpoint' (URL) and the 'Key' (Password).
You send a package of data (JSON) to the URL.
The app catches it and does the work.
ChatGPT can write the JSON for you.
'Hey ChatGPT, write a JSON payload to send a lead to Salesforce API'."

**(Slide: The "Webhook" Secret)**
"Webhooks are your best friend.
Most forms (Typeform, Facebook Lead Ads) can 'POST' to a Webhook.
In Make.com, create a 'Custom Webhook'.
Paste that URL into the form settings.
Boom. Instant data transfer.
No complex API needed.

👉 **ACTION:** Use Postman (free tool) to send a test request to a public API (like PokeAPI)."

It lets you drag and drop the conversation flow.

They are incredibly talented and cost a fraction of a US developer.
You pay them $10/hour. You charge the client $100/hour.
This is arbitrage."

"Interviewing is useless.
Give them a task.
'Here is $50. Build this specific automation in Make.com. You have 24 hours.'
See how clean their code is. See how fast they communicate.
Hire the best one.
Now you just do Sales. They do the Building.

Then White Labeling is for you.
Instead of finding 1 client at a time, find 1 partner who has 50 clients."

"Marketing agencies are scared. They know they need AI, but they don't know how to do it.
You are the savior.
Email the owner: 'I see you run a great SEO agency. Do you offer AI automation to your clients? I can build it for you, under your brand.'
They say yes.
They blast their email list.
They send you 10 orders in one day.
You are now their 'Secret Weapon'.

Investors love it.
If you have $10k/month in stable retainers, that is worth a lot of money.

Keep your churn low."
