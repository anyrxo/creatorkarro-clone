## Lesson 1: Instagram Algorithm Mastery for AI Influencers

### Understanding Instagram's AI Detection

**The challenge**: Instagram can detect AI-generated content and may limit reach.

**How to avoid detection**:
1. **Add imperfections**: Slight blur, grain, natural lighting variations
2. **Avoid perfection**: Too-perfect skin/features trigger AI detection
3. **Use real backgrounds**: Composite AI character into real photos
4. **Vary content**: Mix AI-generated with stock footage
5. **Engage authentically**: Real comments, genuine interactions

**Red flags Instagram looks for**:
- Overly smooth skin
- Perfect symmetry
- Unnatural lighting
- Repeated backgrounds
- Identical poses

**Solutions**:
- Add film grain in post-processing
- Use different LoRA strengths (0.7-0.9)
- Composite into real locations
- Vary prompts significantly
- Use different angles and expressions

## Lesson 2: TikTok Viral Strategies

### Understanding TikTok's Algorithm

**How TikTok decides what goes viral**:

**First 100 views** (Test phase):
- Shows to small audience
- Measures: watch time, likes, comments, shares
- If good performance → next level

**Next 500-1000 views** (Validation):
- Broader audience
- Same metrics tracked
- If still performing → viral potential

**Viral phase** (10K-1M+ views):
- For You Page (FYP)
- Exponential growth
- Can happen to anyone, any time

**Key metrics**:
1. **Watch time**: Most important (keep them watching)
2. **Completion rate**: Did they watch to end?
3. **Rewatches**: Did they watch multiple times?
4. **Shares**: Viral indicator
5. **Comments**: Engagement signal

### Creating Viral TikToks with AI Characters

**Viral formula**:

**Hook (0-3 seconds)**:
- Text overlay with bold claim
- Unexpected visual
- Trending sound starts
- Face close-up or dramatic shot

**Value delivery (3-15 seconds)**:
- Quick tips or story
- Fast pacing (change every 2-3 seconds)
- Captions for sound-off viewing
- Keep them watching

**Payoff (15-30 seconds)**:
- Deliver on promise
- Strong conclusion
- Call-to-action
- Loop back to start (for rewatches)

**Example structure**:
```
0-3 sec: "I made $10K with an AI model" (hook)
3-10 sec: "Here's exactly how I did it" (value)
10-25 sec: Show process/results (proof)
25-30 sec: "Follow for more" (CTA)
```

### Trending Audio Strategy

**How to find trending audio**:
1. Open TikTok
2. Scroll For You Page for 10 minutes
3. Note which sounds appear 3+ times
4. Check sound page (shows usage count)
5. Use sounds with 10K-500K uses

**When to use trending audio**:
- Within 3-7 days of trend starting
- Before it's oversaturated
- When it fits your niche

**How to adapt trends**:
- Don't copy exactly
- Add your unique angle
- Make it relevant to your niche
- Add value, not just entertainment

**Example**:
- **Trend**: "Things I learned this year"
- **Your version**: "Things I learned building an AI influencer"
- **Value add**: Specific, actionable lessons

### Content Types That Go Viral
