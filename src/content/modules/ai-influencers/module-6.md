# Module 6: Legal & Compliance

## Overview
This isn't the fun part, but it's the part that keeps you out of trouble. As AI laws evolve, you need to stay ahead of the curve. This module covers disclosure requirements, copyright issues, platform terms of service, and how to protect your digital assets.

## Lesson 1: The "AI Disclosure" Landscape

Platforms and governments are cracking down on undisclosed AI content. Transparency is key to longevity.

### Platform Rules (2024/2025)

1.  **Instagram/Meta**:
    - **Rule**: You must label AI-generated content if it looks photorealistic.
    - **How to Comply**: Toggle the "AI Label" switch when posting.
    - **Risk**: If you don't, Meta may automatically detect and label it for you (which looks worse) or shadowban your account.

2.  **TikTok**:
    - **Rule**: Mandatory labeling for realistic AI content.
    - **How to Comply**: Use the "AI-generated" toggle before posting.
    - **Risk**: Content removal or account suspension.

3.  **YouTube**:
    - **Rule**: Strict disclosure for realistic content.
    - **Risk**: Demonetization or strikes.

### The "Bio Disclosure" Strategy
Instead of hiding it, own it.
- **Option A (Transparent)**: "100% AI Generated 🤖"
- **Option B (Creative)**: "Digital Art / Virtual Being 🌐"
- **Option C (Subtle)**: "Curated by AI ✨"

**Why disclose?**
- It builds trust.
- It attracts the "tech" audience.
- It protects you from "catfishing" accusations (which can get you banned on dating apps or subscription sites if they think you are impersonating a real person).

## Lesson 2: Copyright & Ownership

Who owns the images you generate?

### The Current Legal Stance (US/EU)
- **Raw AI Generations**: Generally **NOT copyrightable**. If a machine made it, you can't claim exclusive copyright over the raw image.
- **Edited/Modified AI Art**: If you significantly edit, paint over, or composite the image (Photoshop), you **CAN** claim copyright on the *human-created* elements.

### Protecting Your Brand
You can't copyright the *style*, but you can protect the **Character Identity**.
1.  **Trademark**: You can trademark the **Name** and **Logo** of your influencer.
2.  **Story/Lore**: You own the written backstory and captions.
3.  **LoRA/Model**: Your custom-trained LoRA is your trade secret. Don't share the file.

### Using Other People's Faces
**NEVER** train a LoRA on a specific celebrity or real person without permission.
- **Right of Publicity**: Celebrities have the right to control the commercial use of their likeness.
- **Deepfakes**: Creating non-consensual deepfakes (especially adult content) is illegal in many jurisdictions and will get you banned everywhere.
- **Best Practice**: Mix multiple faces or generate a completely unique face using AI to ensure your character doesn't look like a specific real person.

## Lesson 3: Taxes & Business Structure

Your AI influencer is a business. Treat it like one.

### Setting Up Your Entity
- **Sole Proprietorship**: Easiest to start, but personal liability.
- **LLC (Limited Liability Company)**: Recommended once you start making money. Protects your personal assets if your "influencer" gets sued.

### Banking
- **Separate Accounts**: Do not mix personal and business funds.
- **"High Risk" Categories**: Some banks or payment processors (Stripe/PayPal) may flag "adult" or "digital content" businesses.
    - *Solution*: Use creator-friendly banks or payment platforms specifically designed for creators (e.g., Cosmo, Paxum for adult content; standard banks for SFW brand deals).

### Tax Deductions
You can deduct business expenses:
- **Software Subscriptions**: Midjourney, ChatGPT, Adobe Creative Cloud.
- **Hardware**: That new RTX 4090 GPU? It's a business expense.
- **Outsourcing**: Payments to your VAs and editors.
- **Home Office**: A portion of your rent/internet.

## Lesson 4: Ethics & "Catfishing"

Don't be a scammer.

### The Golden Rule
**Never lie about being real.**
- Don't pretend to be a real human in DMs to trick people into sending money for "meetups" or "flights". That is fraud.
- You can maintain "kayfabe" (staying in character), but if asked directly, or in your ToS, clarify that it is a fictional character/entertainment service.

### Dating Apps
- **Tinder/Bumble**: Most ban AI profiles. Do not use them to funnel traffic; you will get banned.
- **AI-Specific Apps**: Use platforms designed for AI companions if that's your niche.

## Your Action Plan

**By the end of this module, you must:**

1.  **Audit Your Bios**: Ensure you have some form of disclosure (e.g., "Virtual Girl", "AI Art", "Digital Creator").
2.  **Check Platform Settings**: Go into your Instagram/TikTok settings and find the "AI Label" toggles so you know where they are.
3.  **Separate Finances**: Open a separate checking account (or at least a PayPal) for your creator income.
4.  **Review Your Content**: Ensure you aren't using any celebrity likenesses or copyrighted logos (like Nike/Gucci) in your generated images without permission.
