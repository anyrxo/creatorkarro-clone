## Lesson 1: Your First Brand Deal

### Understanding Brand Deals in 2024

**The reality**:
- You don't need 100K followers to get paid
- Brands pay for engagement, not just follower count
- Micro-influencers (10K-50K) often get better rates per follower
- Your first deal might be $100-500, not $10,000

**What brands actually pay for**:
- Access to your engaged audience
- Content creation (they get to use your photos/videos)
- Authentic recommendations (your credibility)
- Specific demographics (if you have a niche audience)

### When You're Ready for Brand Deals

**Minimum requirements**:
- 5,000+ followers (some brands accept 1,000+)
- 3-5% engagement rate minimum
- Consistent posting (at least 3x/week)
- Professional-looking content
- Clear niche/audience

**Ideal position**:
- 10,000+ followers
- 5-10% engagement rate
- Media kit ready
- Previous brand collaborations (even unpaid)

### Finding Your First Brand Deal

**Method 1: Direct Outreach** (Fastest)

**Step 1: Identify target brands**
- Brands you already use and love
- Brands in your niche
- Brands your audience would appreciate
- Check if they work with influencers (look at their Instagram tags)

**Step 2: Research their influencer programs**
- Visit their website
- Look for "Influencer Program" or "Brand Ambassador"
- Check their Instagram for tagged creators
- Note what kind of content they share

**Step 3: Create your pitch**

**Bad pitch**:
"Hi! I'd love to work with you. I have 10K followers."

**Good pitch**:
```

- Long-term partnership potential

- They ask you to pay them
- They want full ownership of your content forever
- They refuse to put agreement in writing
- They ask you to lie about the product
- Payment terms are vague or "after we see results"

### Delivering on Brand Deals

**Before creating content**:
1. Get written agreement (email is fine)
2. Clarify deliverables and timeline
3. Ask for brand guidelines
4. Request product samples/info
5. Confirm posting dates

**During content creation**:
1. Create 2-3 options for brand to choose from
2. Follow brand guidelines but maintain your style
3. Be authentic (your audience can tell if you're faking)
4. Include required disclosures (#ad, #sponsored)
5. Send draft for approval before posting

**After posting**:
1. Send screenshots of post + stories
