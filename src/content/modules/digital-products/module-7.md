# Module 7: Scaling to Multiple Products

## Overview
One product is a side hustle. A "Product Suite" is a business. This module teaches you how to increase the Lifetime Value (LTV) of every customer by creating upsells, cross-sells, and a logical "Value Ladder" that keeps them buying for years.

## Lesson 1: The "Backend" Strategy

The first sale is the hardest. The second sale is easy.
**Rule**: A customer who bought once is 10x more likely to buy again than a stranger.

**The Product Suite Model**:
1.  **The Front-End (Acquisition)**: Low cost, high volume. (E.g., $27 Ebook).
2.  **The Order Bump (Immediate)**: "Add this checklist for $9?" (20-30% take rate).
3.  **The Upsell (The Next Step)**: "Want the video walkthrough? Add for $47."
4.  **The Backend (High Ticket)**: "Want me to do it for you? $1,000."

## Lesson 2: Creating Complementary Products

Don't just make random stuff. Solve the *next* problem.

**The "Next Problem" Framework**:
- *Problem 1*: "I don't know what to eat." -> **Product 1**: Meal Plan ($27).
- *New Problem*: "I have the plan, but I hate cooking." -> **Product 2**: 15-Minute Recipes Video Course ($47).
- *New Problem*: "I'm cooking, but I'm lonely." -> **Product 3**: Group Coaching Challenge ($97).

**Action**: Look at your current product. What problem does it create? Solve that one next.

## Lesson 3: Bundles and Flash Sales

How to make cash on demand.

**The Bundle**:
- Take 3 of your small products.
- Package them together.
- "The Ultimate Collection."
- Price it at 50% of the total value.
- *Result*: Higher Average Order Value (AOV).

**The Flash Sale**:
- "It's my birthday! 48-hour sale on everything."
- "Black Friday in July."
- *Note*: Don't do this too often (once a quarter max) or you devalue your brand.

## Lesson 4: Subscription Revenue (The Holy Grail)

Recurring revenue stabilizes your income.

**Types of Subscriptions**:
1.  **The Newsletter**: Paid Substack ($5/month).
2.  **The Community**: Private Discord ($20/month).
3.  **The Software/Tool**: Notion Template Access ($10/month).
4.  **The Content Library**: "Netflix for [Niche]" ($29/month).

**When to launch a sub**:
- Only when you have a steady flow of new leads.
- Churn (cancellations) will kill you if you don't have new people coming in.
