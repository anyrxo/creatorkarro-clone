# Module 7: Scaling to Multiple Products

## Overview
One product is a side hustle. A "Product Suite" is a business. This module teaches you how to increase the Lifetime Value (LTV) of every customer by creating upsells, cross-sells, and a logical "Value Ladder" that keeps them buying for years. We will turn a $27 customer into a $1,000 customer.

## Lesson 1: The "Backend" Strategy

The first sale is the hardest. You have to earn trust. The second sale is easy.
**Rule**: A customer who bought once is 10x more likely to buy again than a stranger.

**The Product Suite Model**:
1.  **The Front-End (Acquisition)**: Low cost, high volume.
    - *Goal*: Get customers. Break even on ads.
    - *Product*: Ebook, Template, Workshop ($27 - $47).
2.  **The Order Bump (Immediate)**: A small add-on at checkout.
    - *Goal*: Increase Average Order Value (AOV).
    - *Product*: Checklist, Audio Version, "Vault" Access ($9 - $17).
3.  **The Upsell (The Next Step)**: Offered immediately after purchase.
    - *Goal*: Profit.
    - *Product*: Video Course, Advanced Masterclass ($47 - $97).
4.  **The Backend (High Ticket)**: Offered via email 30 days later.
    - *Goal*: Scale.
    - *Product*: Coaching, Done-For-You, Mastermind ($1,000+).

## Lesson 2: Creating Complementary Products

Don't just make random stuff. Solve the *next* problem.

**The "Next Problem" Framework**:
Every solution creates a new problem. Your next product should solve that new problem.

*   **Phase 1**: "I don't know what to eat."
    *   *Solution*: **The Keto Meal Plan ($27)**.
*   **Phase 2 (New Problem)**: "I have the plan, but I hate cooking every night."
    *   *Solution*: **The 15-Minute Meal Prep Video Course ($47)**.
*   **Phase 3 (New Problem)**: "I'm cooking, but I'm lonely and losing motivation."
    *   *Solution*: **The 30-Day Group Challenge ($97)**.
*   **Phase 4 (New Problem)**: "I lost the weight, now I want to build muscle."
    *   *Solution*: **The Muscle Building Protocol ($47)**.

**Action**: Look at your current product. What problem does it create? Solve that one next.

## Lesson 3: Bundles and Flash Sales

How to make cash on demand without creating anything new.

**The Bundle**:
- Take 3 of your small products (e.g., Ebook + Template + Workshop).
- Package them together.
- "The Ultimate Collection."
- Price it at 50% of the total value.
- *Result*: Higher Average Order Value (AOV). People love a deal.

**The Flash Sale**:
- "It's my birthday! 48-hour sale on everything."
- "Black Friday in July."
- **Rule**: Don't do this too often (once a quarter max) or you devalue your brand. People will stop buying at full price if they know a sale is coming next week.

## Lesson 4: Subscription Revenue (The Holy Grail)

Recurring revenue stabilizes your income. It turns a "launch" business into a "predictable" business.

**Types of Subscriptions**:
1.  **The Newsletter**: Paid Substack ($5/month). Best for writers.
2.  **The Community**: Private Discord/Circle ($20/month). Best for leaders.
3.  **The Software/Tool**: Notion Template Access ($10/month). Best for system builders.
4.  **The Content Library**: "Netflix for [Niche]" ($29/month). Access to all past and future courses.

**When to launch a sub**:
- Only when you have a steady flow of new leads.
- **Churn** (cancellations) will kill you if you don't have new people coming in.
- **Warning**: Subscriptions are a treadmill. You have to deliver value *every month*. Make sure you are ready for that commitment.

## Lesson 5: The "High-Ticket" Backend

You only need a few of these to double your revenue.

**The "Done-For-You" (DFY) Service**:
- "I'll build your website for you." ($2,000).
- "I'll write your email sequence." ($1,000).

**The "Done-With-You" (Coaching)**:
- "4 weeks of 1-on-1 calls to help you launch." ($1,500).
- "Group Mastermind." ($500/month).

**How to sell it**:
- Don't put a "Buy Now" button.
- Put an "Apply Now" button.
- Get them on a call (or use a long application form).

## Your Action Plan

**By the end of this module, you must:**

1.  **Map Your Value Ladder**: Draw the path from $7 to $997.
2.  **Create an Order Bump**: Add a simple checklist or audio file to your checkout.
3.  **Brainstorm Product #2**: What is the "Next Problem" your students will have?
4.  **Decide on High-Ticket**: Will you offer coaching? Or stay pure digital?
