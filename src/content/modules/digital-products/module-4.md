# Module 4: Zero-Ad Launch Strategies

## Overview
You don't need Facebook Ads to launch. You need a system. This module breaks down the "Hype Cycle"—how to build anticipation, get people begging to buy, and execute a 5-day launch sequence that maximizes revenue using only organic social media.

## Lesson 1: The Pre-Launch (Building Hype)

The mistake most creators make: "Surprise! I made a thing. Buy it."
*Result*: Crickets.

**The "Open Loop" Strategy (14 Days Out)**:
Start talking about the *problem* and the *process*, not the product.

- **Post 1 (The Problem)**: "I've been struggling with [Problem] for years. It's so frustrating because [Pain Points]."
- **Post 2 (The Epiphany)**: "I think I cracked the code. I tried [New Method] and look at these results..."
- **Post 3 (The Tease)**: "A lot of you asked how I did this. I'm putting together a guide. Who would be interested?" (Poll).
- **Post 4 (The Behind-the-Scenes)**: Share a screenshot of you writing the ebook. "Coming soon..."

*Goal*: Build a waitlist of people who are mentally ready to buy.

## Lesson 2: The Waitlist Strategy

Don't launch to the public first. Launch to the VIPs.

**The Waitlist Landing Page**:
- "Join the waitlist for [Product]. Get early access + a 50% discount code."
- Collect emails. These are your hottest leads.

**The "Early Bird" Email**:
- Send the link to the waitlist 24 hours before public launch.
- "It's live for you guys only. Here is your discount code. It expires in 48 hours."

## Lesson 3: The 5-Day Launch Sequence

Once you go public, follow this schedule.

**Day 1: The Announcement (Cart Open)**
- **Theme**: "It's Finally Here!"
- **Action**: Post the cover, the benefits, and the link.
- **Urgency**: "Launch price ends in 5 days."

**Day 2: The Social Proof**
- **Theme**: "Look who's already winning."
- **Action**: Share screenshots of early buyers, DMs saying "Just bought!", or beta tester testimonials.

**Day 3: The FAQ (Objection Handling)**
- **Theme**: "Questions?"
- **Action**: "I've been getting some questions..." (Answer the top 3 objections: Is this for beginners? Do I need software? etc.)

**Day 4: The "What You Get" (Logic)**
- **Theme**: The Stack.
- **Action**: Show a video scrolling through the product. "Here is exactly what's inside."

**Day 5: The Close (Cart Closing)**
- **Theme**: "Last Chance."
- **Action**:
    - Morning: "12 hours left to get the discount."
    - Evening: "Doors closing in 2 hours."
- *Note*: Most sales happen on the last day.

## Lesson 4: Organic Traffic Sources

Where do you find buyers without ads?

**1. Instagram Stories (The Closer)**
- Best for selling to existing followers.
- Use link stickers.
- Post 5-10 times a day during launch.

**2. TikTok/Reels (The Reach)**
- Best for finding *new* people.
- Create a "Pinned Video" explaining the offer.
- Go Live to answer questions.

**3. Twitter/Threads (The Builder in Public)**
- "I just launched X. Here is a thread on why I built it."
- Pin the tweet.

**4. Cold DMs (The Hustle)**
- *Only for high-ticket*.
- Don't spam. "Hey, I saw you were struggling with X. I just made a guide on it, happy to send over the link if you want?"
