# Module 3: Pricing Psychology Mastery

## Overview
Pricing isn't math; it's psychology. Most creators underprice their work out of fear. This module teaches you how to charge what you're worth, use "Anchoring" to make prices look small, and structure offers that make saying "no" feel stupid.

## Lesson 1: The "Value-Based" Pricing Model

Stop trading time for money. Trade **results** for money.

**Cost-Plus Pricing (Bad)**:
"It took me 10 hours to write, so I'll charge $10."
*Result*: You stay poor.

**Value-Based Pricing (Good)**:
"This saves the customer 100 hours of work. What is 100 hours worth to them? $500? Then $50 is a steal."
*Result*: High margins.

**The ROI Calculation**:
If your product helps them make $1,000, charging $100 is a 10x ROI.
If your product saves them $500 in software fees, charging $50 is a no-brainer.

## Lesson 2: The Price Ladder

Don't just have one price. Have three.

### 1. The "Tripwire" ($7 - $27)
*Goal: Convert a stranger into a customer.*
- Impulse buy range.
- "No-brainer" value.
- Example: Templates, Checklists, Mini-Guides.

### 2. The "Core Offer" ($47 - $97)
*Goal: Profit.*
- Requires a bit of thought, but still affordable.
- Complete solution to a specific problem.
- Example: Video Course, Comprehensive Ebook, Bundle.

### 3. The "High-Ticket" ($297 - $997+)
*Goal: Scale.*
- For the top 1% of fans who want speed/access.
- Example: Coaching, Done-For-You Service, Mastermind.

## Lesson 3: Psychological Pricing Hacks

Small tweaks change perception.

**1. The "Charm" Price**
- $97 sells better than $100.
- $27 sells better than $25.
- *Why*: The left-digit effect. We read left to right, so 97 feels closer to 90 than 100.

**2. Price Anchoring**
- Always show a higher price first to make the real price look small.
- *Method A (Strikethrough)*: "~~$197~~ **$47**"
- *Method B (Comparison)*: "Hiring a consultant costs $5,000. This course is $297."

**3. The "Decoy" Effect**
- Offer 3 options to steer them to the middle one.
    - Option A: Ebook ($27)
    - Option B: Ebook + Video Course ($47) -> **Target**
    - Option C: Video Course Only ($47) -> **Decoy** (Makes B look amazing)

## Lesson 4: Handling "It's Too Expensive"

Objections are rarely about money. They are about **risk**.

**The Risk Reversal (Guarantee)**:
- "100% Money-Back Guarantee for 30 Days."
- *Fear*: "Everyone will refund!"
- *Reality*: Refund rates are usually 1-3%. Sales increase by 20-30%. You win.

**The "Cost of Inaction"**:
- Frame the price against the cost of *not* buying.
- "The price is $47. But what is it costing you to stay stuck? To keep wasting hours every week?"

## Your Action Plan

**By the end of this module, you must:**

1.  **Set Your Price**: Pick a price ending in 7 or 9.
2.  **Create an Anchor**: What is the "value" price vs. the "sales" price?
3.  **Write Your Guarantee**: Draft a risk-reversal statement.
4.  **Calculate the ROI**: Write down one sentence explaining the return on investment for the buyer.
