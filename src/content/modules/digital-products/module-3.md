# Module 3: Pricing Psychology Mastery

## Overview
Pricing isn't math; it's psychology. Most creators underprice their work out of fear ("Who am I to charge this?"). This module teaches you how to charge what you're worth, use "Anchoring" to make prices look small, and structure offers that make saying "no" feel stupid. We'll move from "Cost-Plus" pricing to "Value-Based" pricing.

## Lesson 1: The "Value-Based" Pricing Model

Stop trading time for money. Trade **results** for money.

**Cost-Plus Pricing (The Employee Mindset)**:
"It took me 10 hours to write this ebook. I want to make $20/hour. So I'll charge $200... wait, no one will pay that. I'll charge $10."
*Result*: You stay poor. You are pricing based on *your* input, not the *customer's* output.

**Value-Based Pricing (The Entrepreneur Mindset)**:
"This product teaches a freelancer how to land a $1,000 client. If they buy this, they make $1,000. What is that worth to them? Surely $100 is a fair trade for $1,000."
*Result*: High margins. You are pricing based on the *transformation*.

**The ROI Calculation**:
- If your product saves them 10 hours of frustration, and their time is worth $50/hour, you saved them $500. Charging $50 is a 10x ROI.
- If your product helps them lose 10lbs, what is the value of confidence and health? Priceless.

**Action**: Calculate the ROI of your product. Write it down. "This product saves/makes the customer [Amount/Time]."

## Lesson 2: The Price Ladder (The "Yes" Ladder)

Don't just have one price. Have a ladder that captures customers at different stages of trust.

### 1. The "Tripwire" ($7 - $27)
*Goal: Convert a stranger into a customer.*
- **Psychology**: It's easier to get a second dollar than the first dollar. Once someone buys *anything*, they are a "customer."
- **Offer**: Templates, Checklists, Mini-Guides, Swipe Files.
- **Rule**: It must be "No-Brainer" value. If they see it, they should think, "Why is this so cheap?"

### 2. The "Core Offer" ($47 - $97)
*Goal: Profit.*
- **Psychology**: This is the "sweet spot" for digital products. It's high enough to make real money, but low enough to be an impulse buy (under $100).
- **Offer**: Comprehensive Ebook, Video Course, Bundle, Notion System.
- **Rule**: This is your flagship product.

### 3. The "High-Ticket" ($297 - $997+)
*Goal: Scale & Freedom.*
- **Psychology**: Some people have more money than time. They don't want to read a book; they want *you* to help them.
- **Offer**: Group Coaching, Done-For-You Service, 1-on-1 Call, Mastermind.
- **Rule**: Only 1-2% of your audience will buy this, but it will make up 50% of your revenue.

## Lesson 3: Psychological Pricing Hacks

Small tweaks change perception. Humans are irrational. Use that to your advantage.

**1. The "Charm" Price**
- **The Hack**: End prices in 7 or 9.
- **The Data**: $97 sells better than $100. $27 sells better than $25.
- **Why**: The "Left-Digit Effect." We read left to right. $97 feels like "Ninety-something." $100 feels like "One Hundred." The difference feels massive.
- **Pro Tip**: Use "7" for digital products ($7, $27, $47, $97). It implies a calculated value. Use "9" for cheap retail items ($9.99).

**2. Price Anchoring**
- **The Hack**: Always show a higher price first to make the real price look small.
- **Method A (Strikethrough)**: "~~$197~~ **$47** (Limited Time)"
- **Method B (Comparison)**: "Hiring a consultant costs $5,000. This course is $297."
- **Method C (The Stack)**: List the value of every component.
    - Ebook: $47 Value
    - Checklist: $27 Value
    - Video: $97 Value
    - **Total Value: $171**
    - **Your Price: $27**

**3. The "Decoy" Effect**
- **The Hack**: Offer 3 options to steer them to the middle one.
    - **Option A**: Ebook Only ($27) -> "Too cheap, maybe it's bad?"
    - **Option B**: Ebook + Video Course ($47) -> **Target** (Looks like the best deal).
    - **Option C**: Video Course Only ($47) -> **Decoy** (Makes B look amazing because you get the Ebook for free).

## Lesson 4: Handling "It's Too Expensive"

Objections are rarely about money. They are about **risk**.
"Is this a scam?" "Will this work for me?" "Will I regret this?"

**1. The Risk Reversal (Guarantee)**
- **The Fear**: "What if I hate it?"
- **The Fix**: "100% Money-Back Guarantee for 30 Days."
- **The Math**: Refund rates are usually 1-3%. Sales increase by 20-30% when you add a guarantee. You win.
- **The "Action-Based" Guarantee**: "Show me you did the work, and if you didn't get results, I'll refund you + pay you $20." (High confidence).

**2. The "Cost of Inaction"**
- Frame the price against the cost of *not* buying.
- "The price is $47. But what is it costing you to stay stuck? To keep wasting 5 hours every week? That's 20 hours a month. Is your time worth more than $2/hour?"

**3. Payment Plans**
- If your product is over $200, offer a payment plan.
- "3 payments of $97" (Total $291) vs. "$247 One-Time."
- Increases conversion for cash-strapped buyers.

## Lesson 5: The "Scarcity" Lever

People procrastinate. You need to give them a reason to buy *now*.

**Types of Scarcity**:
1.  **Time-Based**: "Launch price ends in 48 hours." (Real deadline).
2.  **Quantity-Based**: "Only 50 spots available for the coaching call." (Real limit).
3.  **Bonus-Based**: "First 100 buyers get the free Audit."

**Ethical Rule**: Never fake scarcity. If you say the price goes up, it must go up. If you fake it, you lose trust forever.

## Your Action Plan

**By the end of this module, you must:**

1.  **Set Your Price**: Pick a price ending in 7 (e.g., $27, $47, $97).
2.  **Create an Anchor**: Calculate the "Total Value" of your stack.
3.  **Write Your Guarantee**: Draft a strong risk-reversal statement.
4.  **Choose a Scarcity Tactic**: Will you have a launch discount? A limited bonus?
