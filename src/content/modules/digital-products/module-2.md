## Lesson 1: The "4-Day Creation Sprint"

Parkinson's Law states: "Work expands to fill the time available for its completion."
If you give yourself 3 months, it will take 3 months. Give yourself 4 days.

**The Schedule**:

**Day 1: The Skeleton (Outline)**
- Don't write sentences. Write headers.
- Brainstorm every question a beginner would ask.
- Arrange them in chronological order (Step 1 to Step 10).
- *Goal*: A complete Table of Contents.

**Day 2: The Brain Dump (Drafting)**
- Turn off your internal editor.
- Record yourself talking through each point (Otter.ai or Loom) if you hate typing.
- Transcribe the audio. It's faster to speak than type.
- *Goal*: A messy, ugly first draft.

**Day 3: The Cleanup (Editing)**
- Now, make it pretty.
- Add screenshots, diagrams, and examples.
- Break up long paragraphs.
- *Goal*: A readable, helpful guide.

**Day 4: The Polish (Design)**
- Create a cover (Canva).
- Format the PDF/Notion page.
- Add a "Welcome" and "What's Next" section.
- *Goal*: A sellable product.

## Lesson 2: Formats That Sell

You don't have to write an ebook. Pick the format that fits your strength.

### 1. The Notion Template
*Best for: Systems, Organizers, Databases.*
- **Pros**: Easy to update, interactive, high perceived value.
- **Examples**: "Second Brain," "Content Calendar," "Finance Tracker."
- **Tool**: Notion (Free).

### 2. The Video Mini-Course
*Best for: Visual skills, Tech tutorials.*
- **Pros**: Higher price point ($47-$97), builds trust.
- **Setup**: Loom (screen recording) + Slides. You don't need to be on camera.
- **Hosting**: YouTube (Unlisted) embedded in a Notion page or Gumroad.

### 3. The "Swipe File" / Resource List
*Best for: Saving time.*
- **Pros**: Easiest to create.
- **Examples**: "50 Email Subject Lines," "100 Viral Hooks," "My Rolodex of Suppliers."
- **Value Proposition**: "Don't reinvent the wheel. Steal my system."

### 4. The Ebook / Guide
*Best for: Deep dives, Strategy.*
- **Pros**: Classic, easy to consume.
- **Tool**: Google Docs -> Export as PDF.

## Lesson 3: Design for Non-Designers

Ugly products don't sell (or get refunded). You need "Perceived Value."

**The "Apple" Aesthetic Rules**:
1.  **Whitespace is King**: Double your margins. Increase line height to 1.5.
2.  **One Font Family**: Use *Inter* or *Roboto*. Don't mix 5 different fonts.
3.  **Accent Color**: Pick ONE brand color (e.g., Electric Blue). Use it for headers and links. Everything else is Black/Grey.
4.  **Visual Breakers**: Every 300 words, insert an image, a quote block, or a bullet list. Wall of text = death.

**Tools**:
- **Canva**: Search "Ebook Template".
- **Gumroad Cover Creator**: Simple tool for product thumbnails.

## Lesson 4: Naming Your Product

The name is 80% of the sale.

**The Title Formula**:
[Adjective] + [Benefit] + [Format]

*   *Boring*: "Instagram Guide"
*   *Better*: "The Viral Instagram Blueprint"
*   *Best*: "The 30-Day Instagram Growth Protocol"

**Power Words to Use**:
- Blueprint, Protocol, System, Vault, Masterclass, Bible, Roadmap.
- Avoid: Guide, Ebook (sounds cheap).
