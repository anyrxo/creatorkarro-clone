# Module 8: Business Operations

## Overview
You are now a CEO, not just a creator. If you treat this like a hobby, it will pay you like a hobby (it will cost you money). If you treat it like a business, it will pay you like a business. This module covers the boring but essential stuff: Legal structure, taxes, hiring help, and organizing your digital life so you don't go crazy.

## Lesson 1: Legal & Taxes (The Basics)

*Disclaimer: I am not a lawyer or accountant. This is general advice. Consult a professional in your jurisdiction.*

**1. Entity Structure**:
- **Sole Prop**: Default. You are the business. Risky. If someone sues "The Business," they sue *you* and can take your house.
- **LLC (Limited Liability Company)**: Separates you from the business. If the business gets sued, your personal assets are protected. **Highly Recommended** once you make your first $1,000.

**2. Separate Finances**:
- **Rule #1**: Never mix personal and business money.
- Open a Business Checking Account (Mercury, Relay, or local bank).
- Get a Business Credit Card (for points and separation).
- Use a tool like **QuickBooks** or **Xero** to track income/expenses.

**3. Sales Tax (Digital Goods)**:
- The "Digital Tax" laws are complex (VAT in Europe, GST in Australia, etc.).
- If you sell to a customer in Germany, you technically owe German VAT.
- **Solution**: Use a "Merchant of Record" (MoR) like **Gumroad**, **LemonSqueezy**, or **Paddle**.
    - They act as the reseller. They collect and remit the tax for you.
    - They charge a higher fee (5%), but it is worth it to avoid jail/fines.

## Lesson 2: Systems & SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures)

If you get hit by a bus, can your business run? If the answer is no, you don't have a business; you have a job.

**The "Loom" Method**:
- You don't need to write 50-page manuals.
- Every time you do a task (answer support, update website, send newsletter), record a **Loom video** of yourself doing it.
- Talk through your thought process. "I'm clicking here because..."
- Save it in a Notion database called "SOPs".
- When you hire someone, just send them the video.

**Essential Systems**:
- **Content Calendar**: Notion or Trello. Plan 2 weeks ahead.
- **Customer Support**: Help Scout or a dedicated Gmail label.
- **File Management**: Google Drive (Organized by Year -> Project -> Assets). Never save files to your desktop.

## Lesson 3: Hiring Your First Help

You can't do it all forever. You will burn out.

**The "Virtual Assistant" (VA)**:
- **Role**: General Admin.
- **Tasks**: Customer support, scheduling posts, research, data entry, inbox management.
- **Cost**: $5-$15/hour (Overseas) or $25+/hour (US).
- **Where to find**: Upwork, OnlineJobs.ph, Twitter.

**The "Specialist"**:
- **Role**: Expert execution.
- **Tasks**: Design, Copywriting, Video Editing, Ads Management.
- **Cost**: Project-based or Retainer.
- **Strategy**: Hire for your *weakness*. If you hate design, hire a designer first. If you hate writing, hire a copywriter.

**The Hiring Process**:
1.  **The Test Project**: Never hire without a paid test. "Create 3 Instagram posts." Pay them $50. See if they follow instructions.
2.  **The Trial Period**: "Let's try 30 days."
3.  **The SOP Handoff**: Give them your Loom videos.

## Lesson 4: The "Creator Burnout" Prevention Plan

Digital products are "passive" income, but the marketing is active. Burnout is the #1 killer of creators.

**Rules for Longevity**:
1.  **Batch Work**: Context switching kills focus.
    - Write all newsletters on Monday.
    - Record all videos on Tuesday.
    - Edit on Wednesday.
2.  **Digital Detox**: Take one day off screens completely (e.g., Saturday). No email. No Instagram.
3.  **The "Enough" Number**: Decide how much money is "enough." Don't chase growth just for ego. If $10k/month covers your dream life, don't kill yourself trying to hit $100k.

## Your Action Plan

**By the end of this module, you must:**

1.  **Open a Business Account**: Separate your money today.
2.  **Choose a Merchant of Record**: Gumroad, LemonSqueezy, or Stripe?
3.  **Record 1 SOP**: Record yourself doing a daily task (e.g., "How I format my newsletter").
4.  **Set Your "Office Hours"**: When are you "closed" for business? Put it in your email signature.
