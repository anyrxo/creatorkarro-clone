# Module 8: Business Operations

## Overview
You are now a CEO, not just a creator. This module covers the boring but essential stuff: Legal structure, taxes, hiring help, and organizing your digital life so you don't go crazy.

## Lesson 1: Legal & Taxes (The Basics)

*Disclaimer: I am not a lawyer or accountant. This is general advice.*

**1. Entity Structure**:
- **Sole Prop**: Default. You are the business. Risky.
- **LLC (Limited Liability Company)**: Separates you from the business. If the business gets sued, they can't take your house. **Highly Recommended**.

**2. Separate Finances**:
- Open a Business Checking Account.
- Never buy groceries with the business card.
- Use a tool like QuickBooks or Xero to track income/expenses.

**3. Sales Tax (Digital Goods)**:
- The "Digital Tax" laws are complex (VAT in Europe, etc.).
- **Solution**: Use a "Merchant of Record" like **Gumroad**, **LemonSqueezy**, or **Paddle**. They handle *all* the sales tax compliance for you. It is worth the extra fee.

## Lesson 2: Systems & SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures)

If you get hit by a bus, can your business run?

**The "Loom" Method**:
- Every time you do a task (answer support, update website, send newsletter), record a Loom video of yourself doing it.
- Save it in a folder called "SOPs".
- When you hire someone, just send them the video.

**Essential Systems**:
- **Content Calendar**: Notion or Trello.
- **Customer Support**: Help Scout or a dedicated Gmail label.
- **File Management**: Google Drive (Organized by Year -> Project).

## Lesson 3: Hiring Your First Help

You can't do it all forever.

**The "Virtual Assistant" (VA)**:
- **Tasks**: Customer support, scheduling posts, research, data entry.
- **Cost**: $5-$15/hour (Overseas) or $25+/hour (US).
- **Where to find**: Upwork, OnlineJobs.ph, Twitter.

**The "Specialist"**:
- **Tasks**: Design, Copywriting, Video Editing.
- **Cost**: Project-based.
- **Strategy**: Hire for your *weakness*. If you hate design, hire a designer first.

## Lesson 4: The "Creator Burnout" Prevention Plan

Digital products are "passive" income, but the marketing is active.

**Rules for Longevity**:
1.  **Batch Work**: Write all newsletters on Monday. Record all videos on Tuesday.
2.  **Digital Detox**: Take one day off screens completely.
3.  **The "Enough" Number**: Decide how much money is "enough." Don't chase growth just for ego.

## Your Action Plan

**By the end of this module, you must:**

1.  **Open a Business Account**: Separate your money.
2.  **Choose a Merchant of Record**: Gumroad, LemonSqueezy, or Stripe?
3.  **Record 1 SOP**: Record yourself doing a daily task.
4.  **Set Your "Office Hours"**: When are you "closed" for business?
