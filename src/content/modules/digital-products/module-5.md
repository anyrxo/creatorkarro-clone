# Module 5: Sales Funnel Automation

## Overview
Launching is great, but you can't launch every week. You need a system that sells for you 24/7. This module teaches you how to build an "Evergreen Funnel"—automating the journey from stranger to customer using email sequences and landing pages.

## Lesson 1: The Anatomy of a Funnel

A funnel is just a path.
**Traffic -> Lead Magnet -> Email Sequence -> Sale.**

**The Components**:
1.  **The Squeeze Page**: A simple page offering a free thing in exchange for an email.
2.  **The Lead Magnet**: The free thing (Checklist, Mini-Video).
3.  **The Tripwire (Optional)**: A low-cost offer ($7) shown immediately after they sign up.
4.  **The Email Sequence**: 3-5 emails that build trust and pitch the main product.

## Lesson 2: The "Lead Magnet" That Converts

Your freebie must be valuable enough to pay for, but short enough to consume in 5 minutes.

**Good Lead Magnets**:
- "The 10-Point Checklist"
- "The 5-Minute Video Tutorial"
- "The Resource List"

**Bad Lead Magnets**:
- "My Newsletter" (Boring)
- "A 50-Page Ebook" (Too long, they won't read it).

**The "Specific Solves" Rule**:
Solve ONE specific problem completely.
*Example*: "How to write a viral hook" (Good) vs. "How to grow on Instagram" (Too broad).

## Lesson 3: The 5-Day Email Sequence (The "Soap Opera" Sequence)

Once you have their email, what do you say?

**Email 1: The Welcome + Delivery**
- Subject: Here is your [Freebie]!
- Content: Link to the download. Introduce yourself briefly. "P.S. Keep an eye out tomorrow for my biggest secret."

**Email 2: The Backstory (Drama)**
- Subject: I almost quit...
- Content: Tell a story of your struggle. Relate to their pain. "I tried everything until I discovered..."

**Email 3: The Epiphany (The Solution)**
- Subject: The one thing that changed everything.
- Content: Explain the "New Mechanism" (your method). "It wasn't my fault; it was the old way."

**Email 4: The Hidden Benefits**
- Subject: It's not just about [Result]...
- Content: Show the secondary benefits. "Making money is great, but the freedom is better." Soft pitch the product.

**Email 5: The Urgency (The Close)**
- Subject: Last chance? (Optional logic).
- Content: "If you're ready to solve this, join [Product]. Here is the link."

## Lesson 4: Tech Stack for Automation

You don't need expensive tools.

**The "Free/Cheap" Stack**:
- **Email**: ConvertKit (Free for 1k subs) or MailerLite.
- **Landing Page**: Carrd ($19/year) or ConvertKit's built-in pages.
- **Product Hosting**: Gumroad (No monthly fee, takes %) or LemonSqueezy.

**The "Pro" Stack**:
- **All-in-One**: Kajabi or Stan Store.
- **Email**: ActiveCampaign.
- **Funnel Builder**: ClickFunnels or Framer.

**Setting it Up**:
1.  Create Form in ConvertKit.
2.  Set up "Automation": When [Form Subscribed] -> Send [Sequence].
3.  Paste Form link in Instagram Bio.
