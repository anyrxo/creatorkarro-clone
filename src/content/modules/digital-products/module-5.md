# Module 5: Sales Funnel Automation

## Overview
Launching is great, but you can't launch every week. It's exhausting, and your audience will get "launch fatigue." You need a system that sells for you 24/7. This module teaches you how to build an "Evergreen Funnel"—automating the journey from stranger to customer using email sequences and landing pages. We will turn your Instagram bio into a cash machine.

## Lesson 1: The Anatomy of a Funnel

A funnel is just a path. You are guiding the customer by the hand.
**Traffic -> Lead Magnet -> Email Sequence -> Sale.**

**The Components**:
1.  **The Squeeze Page (Landing Page)**: A simple page offering a free thing in exchange for an email. It has one job: Get the email.
2.  **The Lead Magnet**: The free thing (Checklist, Mini-Video, Template). It must be valuable enough to pay for.
3.  **The Tripwire (Optional)**: A low-cost offer ($7-$27) shown *immediately* after they sign up (on the Thank You page). This pays for your ads (if you run them).
4.  **The Email Sequence**: 3-5 emails that build trust, deliver value, and pitch the main product.

## Lesson 2: The "Lead Magnet" That Converts

Your freebie must be valuable enough to pay for, but short enough to consume in 5 minutes.

**Good Lead Magnets**:
- **The Checklist**: "The 10-Point Launch Checklist." (High utility).
- **The Mini-Video**: "How to set up your bio in 5 minutes." (Visual).
- **The Resource List**: "My Top 10 AI Tools." (Saves research time).
- **The Template**: "3 Email Scripts for Cold Outreach." (Copy/Paste).

**Bad Lead Magnets**:
- "My Newsletter" (Boring. No one wants more email).
- "A 50-Page Ebook" (Too long. They will download it and never read it. If they don't consume the freebie, they won't buy the paid product).

**The "Specific Solves" Rule**:
Solve ONE specific problem completely.
*   *Bad*: "How to grow on Instagram." (Too broad).
*   *Good*: "How to write a viral hook in 30 seconds." (Specific).

## Lesson 3: The 5-Day Email Sequence (The "Soap Opera" Sequence)

Once you have their email, what do you say? You need to entertain them while you sell.

**Email 1: The Welcome + Delivery (Day 0)**
- **Subject**: Here is your [Freebie]!
- **Content**:
    - Link to the download (Clear and bold).
    - Introduce yourself briefly (The "Who am I").
    - Set expectations: "I'll be sending you some more tips over the next few days."
    - **P.S.**: "Keep an eye out tomorrow for my biggest secret."

**Email 2: The Backstory / Drama (Day 1)**
- **Subject**: I almost quit... / The embarrassing truth...
- **Content**: Tell a story of your struggle. Relate to their pain. "I tried everything until I discovered..."
- **Goal**: Empathy. "He is just like me."

**Email 3: The Epiphany / The Solution (Day 2)**
- **Subject**: The one thing that changed everything.
- **Content**: Explain the "New Mechanism" (your method). "It wasn't my fault; it was the old way. The new way is [Your Method]."
- **Goal**: Shift their belief.

**Email 4: The Hidden Benefits (Day 3)**
- **Subject**: It's not just about [Result]...
- **Content**: Show the secondary benefits. "Making money is great, but the freedom is better." "Losing weight is great, but having energy for your kids is better."
- **Soft Pitch**: "If you want to achieve this, check out [Product]."

**Email 5: The Urgency / The Close (Day 4)**
- **Subject**: Last chance? (Optional logic).
- **Content**: "If you're ready to solve this, join [Product]. Here is the link."
- **Bonus**: "If you buy today, I'll throw in [Bonus]."

## Lesson 4: Tech Stack for Automation

You don't need expensive tools. You can start for free.

**The "Free/Cheap" Stack (Recommended for Beginners)**:
- **Email**: **ConvertKit** (Free for 1k subs) or **MailerLite**.
- **Landing Page**: **Carrd** ($19/year) or ConvertKit's built-in pages.
- **Product Hosting**: **Gumroad** (No monthly fee, takes %) or **LemonSqueezy**.

**The "Pro" Stack (For Scaling)**:
- **All-in-One**: **Kajabi** or **Stan Store**.
- **Email**: **ActiveCampaign**.
- **Funnel Builder**: **ClickFunnels** or **Framer**.

**Setting it Up (ConvertKit Example)**:
1.  Create a "Form" in ConvertKit.
2.  Create a "Sequence" (Write your 5 emails).
3.  Create an "Automation": When [Form Subscribed] -> Send [Sequence].
4.  Paste the Form link in your Instagram Bio.

## Lesson 5: The "Tripwire" Strategy (Advanced)

How to make money *before* you send an email.

**The Flow**:
1.  User enters email for Free Checklist.
2.  User clicks "Submit."
3.  **Redirect**: Instead of a "Thank You" page, they go to a "Special Offer" page.
4.  **The Offer**: "Wait! Your download is on its way. While you wait, get my [Advanced Template] for just $7 (Usually $27). This offer expires when you close this page."
5.  **The Math**: If 10% of people buy, you make money on every lead.
