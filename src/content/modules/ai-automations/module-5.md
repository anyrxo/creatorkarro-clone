# Module 5: Client Acquisition

## Overview
You have a $2,000 service. How do you find people to buy it? You can't just post on Instagram and hope. You need a B2B sales strategy. This module covers the "Loom Outreach" method, LinkedIn authority building, and how to close deals on Zoom without being a "salesy" weirdo.

## Lesson 1: The "Free Value" Audit (Loom Strategy)

Cold emailing text is dead. "Hi, I sell chatbots" gets deleted. Cold video is alive.

**The Strategy**:
1.  **Find a Lead**: Go to Google Maps. Search "Real Estate Agency [City]." Find one with a decent website but no chatbot.
2.  **The Audit**: Go to their website. Find a problem (e.g., "I tried to contact you but the form was long," or "I couldn't find your pricing").
3.  **The Recording**: Open Loom (Free). Record your screen for 2 minutes.
    - "Hey [Name], I was on your site and noticed X. I actually built a quick demo of how AI could fix this. Check it out..."
4.  **The Demo**: Switch tabs to Voiceflow. Show a simple bot you built for them (put their logo on it). "See? It answers the pricing question instantly."
5.  **The Send**: Email the video.
    - **Subject**: "Video for [Name] (AI Idea)"
    - **Body**: "Hey [Name], made this 2-minute video for you. Let me know what you think."

**Why it works**: Reciprocity. You gave value (the idea/demo) *before* asking for money.

## Lesson 2: LinkedIn Authority Building

Your LinkedIn profile is your landing page.

**Profile Optimization**:
- **Photo**: Professional headshot. No selfies.
- **Headline**: Not "CEO of Agency." Use "Helping [Niche] save 20 hours/week with AI Automation."
- **Banner**: A clear value proposition. "We build AI Systems for Real Estate Agents."

**Content Strategy**:
- Post 3x a week.
- **Type 1: The Case Study**: "Here is how I automated a Real Estate Agent's follow-up." (Show the result).
- **Type 2: The Mechanism**: "Here is the Make.com backend." (Show the complexity. People pay for what they don't understand).
- **Type 3: The Vision**: "AI isn't coming; it's here. Here is why [Niche] needs to adapt."

## Lesson 3: The Sales Call (The "Doctor" Frame)

Do not "pitch." Diagnose.
If a doctor says, "You need surgery," you don't say, "Can I get a discount?" You say, "When can we start?"

**The Script**:
1.  **The Diagnosis**: "Tell me about your current lead process. What happens when a lead comes in?"
2.  **The Pain**: "How long does it take you to reply? How many leads do you think you're losing?"
3.  **The Cost**: "If you lose 5 leads a month, and one lead is worth $5,000... that's $25,000/month you're losing." (Make the pain real).
4.  **The Prescription**: "Okay, I can fix that. I'll install an AI agent that captures those leads instantly. It stops the bleeding."
5.  **The Price**: "It's a $2,000 setup fee and $500/month to keep it running."

**Objection Handling**:
- *"It's too expensive."* -> "Compared to what? Hiring a receptionist is $3,000/month. This is $500. And it works 24/7."
- *"Will it sound like a robot?"* -> "Let me show you a demo right now. It uses GPT-4. It's smarter than most interns."

## Lesson 4: Pricing & Contracts

**The Proposal**:
- Keep it simple. One page.
- "Deliverables: 1 AI Chatbot, 1 Lead Automation, 30 Days Support."
- "Investment: $2,500."
- "Timeline: 14 Days."

**Payment**:
- **Rule**: Always take payment *before* you start building.
- Use **Stripe Payment Links**. Send the link in the Zoom chat or immediately after the call.
- "I can start as soon as the deposit is handled."

**The Contract**:
- Use a simple "Service Agreement."
- Key clause: "Client owns the data. Agency owns the IP (the automation logic)."

## Lesson 5: Where to Find Leads

1.  **Google Maps**: "Dentists near me." Look for ones with ads (they have money) but bad websites.
2.  **LinkedIn Sales Navigator**: Filter by "Owner" in "Real Estate" with "11-50 employees."
3.  **Upwork**: Search for "Zapier Expert" or "Chatbot Developer." Apply to jobs, but pitch the full agency service.
4.  **Local Networking**: Go to BNI or Chamber of Commerce meetings. You will be the only "AI Guy" there. You will be a celebrity.

2.  **Optimize Your LinkedIn**: Change your headline today.
3.  **Practice the Script**: Roleplay the sales call with a friend. Record it and listen to yourself.
4.  **Create a Stripe Link**: Create a product called "AI Setup" for $2,000.
