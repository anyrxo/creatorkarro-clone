## Lesson 1: The "Free Value" Audit (Loom Strategy)

Cold emailing text is dead. Cold video is alive.

**The Strategy**:
1.  Find a potential client (e.g., a Real Estate Agent).
2.  Go to their website. Find a problem (e.g., no chatbot, slow load, broken form).
3.  Record a 2-minute Loom video.
    - "Hey [Name], I was on your site and noticed X. I actually built a quick demo of how AI could fix this. Check it out..."
4.  Show the demo (The Pizza Bot you built, but customized for them).
5.  Email the video. Subject: "Video for [Name] (AI Idea)".

**Why it works**: Reciprocity. You gave value first.

## Lesson 2: LinkedIn Authority Building

**Profile Optimization**:
- **Headline**: Not "CEO of Agency." Use "Helping [Niche] save 20 hours/week with AI."
- **Banner**: A clear value proposition.

**Content Strategy**:
- Post "Case Studies" (even if they are hypothetical at first).
- "Here is how I automated a Real Estate Agent's follow-up."
- Show the *backend* (screenshots of Make.com). People love seeing the "mechanism."

## Lesson 3: The Sales Call (The "Doctor" Frame)

Do not "pitch." Diagnose.

**The Script**:
1.  **The Diagnosis**: "Tell me about your current lead process. Where is it breaking?"
2.  **The Pain**: "How much is that costing you? How many leads are you losing?"
3.  **The Prescription**: "Okay, I can fix that. I'll install an AI agent that captures those leads instantly."
4.  **The Price**: "It's a $2,000 setup fee and $500/month to keep it running."

**Objection Handling**:
- *"It's too expensive."* -> "You said you lose 5 leads a month. One lead is worth $5,000. This pays for itself in week 1."
- *"Will it sound like a robot?"* -> "Let me show you a demo right now."

## Lesson 4: Pricing & Contracts

**The Proposal**:
- Keep it simple. One page.
- "Deliverables: 1 AI Chatbot, 1 Lead Automation, 30 Days Support."
- "Investment: $2,500."

**Payment**:
- Always take payment *before* you start building.
- Use Stripe Payment Links.
