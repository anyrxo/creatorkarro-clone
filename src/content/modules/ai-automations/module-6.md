# Module 6: Service Delivery

## Overview
Selling is easy. Delivery is hard. This module teaches you how to manage client expectations, handle "scope creep," and turn one project into a long-term retainer. We will cover the entire lifecycle from "Signed Contract" to "Monthly Report."

## Lesson 1: The Onboarding Call

**The Goal**: Get everything you need to build so you never have to bug the client again.

**The Checklist**:
1.  **Access**: Get logins for their CRM, Website, Facebook Page, etc. (Use a password manager like LastPass or 1Password to share securely).
2.  **Assets**: Get their logo (SVG/PNG), brand colors (Hex codes), and "Knowledge Base" documents (PDFs).
3.  **Timeline**: Set expectations. "I will have the first draft in 5 days. We launch in 10 days."
4.  **Communication**: "We communicate via Slack/Email. I reply within 24 hours." (Set boundaries).

## Lesson 2: Managing Scope Creep

**The Problem**: Client says "Can you also just add this one little thing?" 10 times. Suddenly, a 10-hour project becomes a 50-hour project.
**The Solution**: The "Phase 2" Bucket.

**How to say No**:
"That's a great idea! It's outside the scope of this current sprint (Phase 1), but let's put it in the 'Phase 2' bucket. Once we launch this, I can send you a quote for that add-on."
- *Result*: You look professional, and you get paid for extra work.

## Lesson 3: The "Handoff" & Training

Don't just email them the login and disappear. That leads to confusion and cancellation.

**The Handoff Call (Zoom)**:
1.  **Demo**: Show them how it works live. "Here is me submitting a form. Here is the email arriving."
2.  **Training**: Teach them how to read the logs or check the leads. "Here is where the leads go in the CRM."
3.  **Recording**: Record the call and send it to them. "Watch this if you forget."

**The "User Manual"**:
- Create a simple Notion doc with screenshots. "How to restart the bot," "How to update the pricing."

## Lesson 4: The Retainer (Monthly Maintenance)

What do you do for $500/month? You sell **Peace of Mind**.

**The Deliverables**:
1.  **Monitoring**: Check the logs once a week to make sure no errors. (APIs change, tokens expire).
2.  **Optimization**: "I noticed users are asking about X, so I added that to the knowledge base."
3.  **Reporting**: Send a monthly email.
    - **Subject**: Monthly AI Report - [Month]
    - **Body**: "The bot handled 500 chats. It booked 20 appointments. It saved you approx. 40 hours of support time."
    - *Value*: Remind them why they pay you.

## Lesson 5: Scaling Your Agency

You can only handle 5-10 clients alone. To grow, you need a team.

**The First Hire**:
- **The Developer**: Hire a Make.com expert on Upwork to build the workflows. You do the sales.
- **Pay**: Project-based ($500 per bot). You keep the $1,500 profit.

**The "White Label" Model**:
- Partner with another agency. You sell, they build. You split the profit 50/50.

## Your Action Plan

**By the end of this module, you must:**

1.  **Create an Onboarding Form**: A Google Form asking for logins, assets, and brand colors.
2.  **Draft a "Scope of Work" Template**: A document that clearly says what is IN and what is OUT.
3.  **Set Up a Support Email**: Where do they email if it breaks? (e.g., support@youragency.com).
4.  **Create a Reporting Template**: Draft the monthly email you will send.
