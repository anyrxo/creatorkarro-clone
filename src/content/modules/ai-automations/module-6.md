# Module 6: Service Delivery

## Overview
Selling is easy. Delivery is hard. This module teaches you how to manage client expectations, handle "scope creep," and turn one project into a long-term retainer.

## Lesson 1: The Onboarding Call

**The Goal**: Get everything you need to build.

**The Checklist**:
1.  **Access**: Get logins for their CRM, Website, etc. (Use a password manager like LastPass).
2.  **Assets**: Get their logo, brand colors, and "Knowledge Base" documents.
3.  **Timeline**: "I will have the first draft in 5 days. We launch in 10 days."

## Lesson 2: Managing Scope Creep

**The Problem**: Client says "Can you also just add this one little thing?" 10 times.
**The Solution**: The "Phase 2" Bucket.

**How to say No**:
"That's a great idea! It's outside the scope of this current sprint, but let's put it in the 'Phase 2' bucket. Once we launch this, I can send you a quote for that add-on."

## Lesson 3: The "Handoff" & Training

Don't just email them the login.

**The Handoff Call**:
1.  **Demo**: Show them how it works live.
2.  **Training**: Teach them how to read the logs or check the leads.
3.  **Recording**: Record the call and send it to them.

## Lesson 4: The Retainer (Monthly Maintenance)

What do you do for $500/month?

1.  **Monitoring**: Check the logs once a week to make sure no errors.
2.  **Optimization**: "I noticed users are asking about X, so I added that to the knowledge base."
3.  **Reporting**: Send a monthly email: "The bot handled 500 chats and booked 20 appointments this month."

## Your Action Plan

**By the end of this module, you must:**

1.  **Create an Onboarding Form**: A Google Form asking for logins and assets.
2.  **Draft a "Scope of Work" Template**: A document that clearly says what is IN and what is OUT.
3.  **Set Up a Support Email**: Where do they email if it breaks?
