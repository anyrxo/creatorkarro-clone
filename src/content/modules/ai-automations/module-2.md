# Module 2: The Tech Stack

## Overview
You don't need to learn Python. You just need to master "Low-Code" tools. This module introduces the "Holy Trinity" of AI automation: **Make.com** (The Glue), **OpenAI API** (The Brain), and **Voiceflow/Botpress** (The Interface).

## Lesson 1: Make.com (Formerly Integromat)

This is the backbone of your agency. It connects App A to App B.

**Key Concepts**:
- **Scenario**: A workflow (e.g., "When a new lead comes in, send an email").
- **Module**: A step in the workflow (e.g., "Google Sheets - Add Row").
- **Trigger**: What starts the automation (e.g., "New Email Received").
- **Router**: Splitting the path (e.g., "If lead is VIP, send SMS. If lead is cold, add to spreadsheet").

**Why Make vs. Zapier?**
- Make is cheaper.
- Make is more visual and handles complex logic better.
- Zapier is easier for beginners, but Make is for pros.

## Lesson 2: The OpenAI API (The Brain)

This is what makes the automation "intelligent."

**How it works**:
- You send text to GPT-4 via Make.com.
- You give it a "System Prompt" (Instructions).
- It returns a structured answer.

**Example Use Case**:
- *Input*: An angry customer email.
- *AI Step*: "Analyze the sentiment of this email. If negative, draft a polite apology."
- *Output*: A drafted email ready to send.

## Lesson 3: Chatbot Builders (Voiceflow & Botpress)

These tools let you build visual conversation flows for websites.

**Voiceflow**:
- Best for: Visual design, ease of use, prototyping.
- Features: Drag-and-drop interface, "Knowledge Base" upload (upload a PDF and the bot learns it).

**Botpress**:
- Best for: Developers, complex integrations.
- Features: Open source, highly customizable.

**Recommendation**: Start with **Voiceflow**. It's the most user-friendly for agencies.

## Lesson 4: Database Tools (Airtable)

You need a place to store data. Google Sheets is okay. Airtable is better.

**Why Airtable?**
- It's a database that looks like a spreadsheet.
- You can link records (e.g., link a "Client" to their "Projects").
- It integrates perfectly with Make.com.

## Your Action Plan

**By the end of this module, you must:**

1.  **Create Accounts**: Sign up for Make.com (Free tier), OpenAI API (add $5 credit), and Voiceflow.
2.  **Build Your First Scenario**: Create a simple automation in Make (e.g., "Typeform to Email").
3.  **Get Your API Key**: Generate an OpenAI API key and save it securely.

**Next Steps**: You have the tools. Now let's build a product. Module 3 covers **Service 1 - AI Chatbots**.
