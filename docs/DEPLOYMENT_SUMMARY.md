### Rollback Plan

**Rollback Availability:** Immediate (5-10 minutes)

**Rollback Methods:**
1. Automated backup restore (recommended)
2. Manual version specification
3. Virtual environment restore
4. Clean reinstall

**Rollback Documentation:** `docs/ROLLBACK_PLAN.md`

**When to Rollback:**
- API fails to start
- Critical endpoints failing (>25%)
- Performance degradation >50%
