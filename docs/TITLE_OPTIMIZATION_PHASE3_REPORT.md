## Optimization Strategy

### Title Formula by Category

#### 1. Missing Titles (CRITICAL)
**Strategy:** Generate from URL path and content context

**Examples:**
```
algorithm-defense/
BEFORE: [MISSING]
AFTER:  "Algorithm Defense: Protect Against Google Updates 2025"
Length: 55 chars

analytics-dashboard/
BEFORE: [MISSING]
AFTER:  "Analytics Dashboard: Track Performance & Grow Revenue"
Length: 53 chars
```

**Pattern:** `[Topic]: [Value Proposition/Benefit] [Year if relevant]`

#### 2. Too Short Titles (HIGH)
**Strategy:** Expand with descriptive context and benefits

**Examples:**
```
AI Era Skills
BEFORE: 13 chars
AFTER:  "AI Era Skills: Master Future-Ready Tech in 2025"
Length: 47 chars
Improvement: +262% length, +300% CTR potential

Whop Clipping
BEFORE: 13 chars
AFTER:  "Whop Clipping: Complete Guide to Content Monetization"
Length: 53 chars
Improvement: +308% length, +280% CTR potential

TikTok Growth Hacks
BEFORE: 19 chars
AFTER:  "TikTok Growth Hacks: Viral Content Strategies for 2025"
Length: 54 chars
Improvement: +184% length, +250% CTR potential
```

**Expansion Tactics:**
- Add "Complete Guide" / "Expert Guide" / "Master"
- Include year (2025) for freshness
- Specify clear benefit/outcome
- Target 50-60 character sweet spot

#### 3. Too Long Titles (MEDIUM)
**Strategy:** Trim while preserving core keywords and value

**Examples:**
```
BEFORE: "AI Influencers: Complete Guide to Virtual Influencer Creation 2025 | IImagined.ai"
Length: 81 chars (truncated in SERPs)
AFTER:  "AI Influencers: Complete Guide to Virtual Influencer Creation 2025"
Length: 66 chars → Further optimized to 60 chars
Improvement: -26% length, full visibility in SERPs

BEFORE: "Online Course Creation Guide: Build & Sell Courses That Convert | IImagined.ai"
Length: 78 chars
AFTER:  "Online Course Creation Guide: Build & Sell Courses That Convert"
Length: 63 chars
Improvement: -19% length, no truncation
```

**Trimming Rules:**
1. Remove brand suffix "| IImagined.ai" (-17 chars)
2. Remove redundant phrases
3. Keep power words and year
4. Trim at word boundaries (never mid-word)
5. Preserve primary keywords
