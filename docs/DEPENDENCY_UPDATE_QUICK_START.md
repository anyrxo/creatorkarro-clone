## Quick Deploy (3 Commands)

```bash
# 1. Update dependencies
cd C:/Users/manna/Downloads/Website/api
bash ../scripts/update-python-deps.sh

# 2. Test API server
python market-data.py
# Keep running in this terminal

# 3. Test endpoints (in new terminal)
bash ../scripts/test-api-endpoints.sh
```

**Expected Result:** All tests pass ✅

---

## Complete Automated Check (Recommended)

```bash
cd C:/Users/manna/Downloads/Website
bash scripts/run-all-dependency-checks.sh
```

This runs:
1. Compatibility check
2. Dependency update
3. Security audit
4. API endpoint tests

## Next Steps

### 1. Development Testing (Today)

```bash
cd C:/Users/manna/Downloads/Website
bash scripts/run-all-dependency-checks.sh
```

### 2. Staging Deployment (Tomorrow)

- Deploy updated requirements.txt
- Run for 24-48 hours
- Monitor error logs
- Verify data accuracy

### 3. Production Deployment (Within 7 days)

- Choose low-traffic window
- Deploy during maintenance window
- Monitor real-time
- Verify all endpoints

## Support

### If Tests Pass ✅

1. Review deployment report: `docs/security/DEPENDENCY_UPDATE_REPORT.md`
2. Follow deployment checklist: `docs/PYTHON_UPDATE_CHECKLIST.md`
3. Deploy to staging
4. Monitor for 24-48 hours
5. Deploy to production

### If Tests Fail ❌

1. Check error messages in terminal
2. Review API server logs
3. Run compatibility check: `python scripts/check-python-compatibility.py`
4. Rollback if needed (automatic in update script)
5. Review troubleshooting section in checklist

## FAQ

**Q: Do I need to change any code?**
A: No, zero code changes required. ✅

**Q: What if something breaks?**
A: Automatic rollback is built into the update script. Manual rollback takes 30 seconds.

**Q: How long does the update take?**
A: ~5-10 minutes for installation + testing.

**Q: Is this safe for production?**
A: Yes, but test in staging first (recommended 24-48 hours).

**Q: When should I do this?**
A: ASAP - critical security vulnerabilities are fixed.

**Q: What about the API downtime?**
A: Zero downtime - update, test, then restart API server.
