**After:** 1 low-severity vulnerability (pip 25.2)

**Vulnerabilities patched:**
1. ✓ cryptography OpenSSL vulnerability (GHSA-79v4-65xg-pq4g)
2. ✓ flask-cors case-insensitive path matching (GHSA-43qf-4rqw-9q2g)
3. ✓ flask-cors URL path normalization (GHSA-8vgw-p6qm-5gr7)
4. ✓ flask-cors regex priority mismatch (GHSA-7rxf-gvfg-47g4)
5. ✓ requests .netrc credential leak (GHSA-9hjg-9r4m-mvj7)
6. ✓ setuptools ReDoS vulnerability (PYSEC-2022-43012)
7. ✓ setuptools path traversal (PYSEC-2025-49)
8. ✓ urllib3 Pyodide redirect control (GHSA-48p4-8xcf-vxj5)

**Remaining vulnerability:**
- pip 25.2 tarfile extraction vulnerability (GHSA-4xh5-x5gv-qwph)
  - **Severity:** Low (requires malicious sdist installation)
  - **Mitigation:** Use Python 3.12+ (PEP 706 safe extraction)
  - **Timeline:** Fix scheduled for pip 25.3 release

### Performance Validation
**Expected improvements (based on benchmarks):**
- NumPy 2.x: 15-30% faster array operations
- Pandas 2.x: Up to 50% memory reduction (Copy-on-Write)
- Flask 3.x: Improved async support and JSON serialization

**Actual validation:** Not measured in development environment

---

## Issues Encountered & Resolutions

### Issue 1: Unicode Console Encoding Errors
**Symptom:** Windows console unable to display Unicode characters (checkmarks, emojis)
```
UnicodeEncodeError: 'charmap' codec can't encode character '\u2713'
```

**Impact:** Cosmetic only - no functional impact

**Resolution:** Not required for deployment success. API functionality unaffected.

**Recommendation:** For production deployment:
```python
import sys
sys.stdout.reconfigure(encoding='utf-8')
```

### Issue 2: Initial Security Audit Found 10 Vulnerabilities
**Symptom:** pip-audit detected 10 known vulnerabilities after initial update

**Impact:** Security risk - multiple CVEs and GHSA advisories

**Resolution:**
1. Updated requirements.txt with patched versions
2. Re-ran pip install with --upgrade flag
3. Verified patches with second pip-audit scan

**Result:** 9 of 10 vulnerabilities resolved (90% improvement)

### Issue 3: Flask Deprecation Warning
**Symptom:** DeprecationWarning for `flask.__version__` attribute

**Impact:** Minor - warning only, no breaking changes

**Resolution:** Not required immediately. Scheduled for removal in Flask 3.2.

**Future mitigation:** Use `importlib.metadata.version("flask")` instead
