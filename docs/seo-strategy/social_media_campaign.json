        "5/ THE COLLABORATION MULTIPLIER\n\n‚Ä¢ Guest posts with complementary accounts\n‚Ä¢ Cross-promotion partnerships\n‚Ä¢ Joint live sessions\n‚Ä¢ Shared giveaways\n\n80% of my growth came from collaborations",
        "6/ ALGORITHM HACKING (Ethical)\n\n‚Ä¢ Post consistently (2-3x daily)\n‚Ä¢ Respond to comments within 30 minutes\n‚Ä¢ Use all Instagram features (Reels, Stories, IGTV)\n‚Ä¢ Create 'save-worthy' content\n\nAlgorithm rewards consistency + engagement",
