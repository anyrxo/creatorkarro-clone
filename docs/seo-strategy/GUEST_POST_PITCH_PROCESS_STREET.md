**UNIQUE PROCESS INSIGHTS I CAN PROVIDE**:

1. **Systematic Process Audit Methodology**
   - 7-category process mapping system
   - ROI calculation framework for process automation
   - Priority matrix for automation sequence planning
   - Real data from 1,600+ process assessments

2. **Process Documentation Standards**
   - Template library for common business processes
   - Documentation requirements for automation readiness
   - Handoff protocols between manual and automated steps
   - Quality control checkpoints for process accuracy

3. **Automation Implementation Process**
