5. Monitor crawl stats and indexing improvements

INTEGRATION REQUIRED:
The components are ready but need to be added to blog post templates.
See RELATED_POSTS_INTEGRATION.md for detailed integration guide.

Example integration:
```tsx
import RelatedPosts from '@/components/blog/RelatedPosts'

export default function BlogPost() {
  return (
    <article>
      {/* Your blog content */}
      <RelatedPosts currentSlug="your-post-slug" limit={6} />
    </article>
  )
}
```

IMPACT:
This lays the foundation for 60-70% internal linking coverage
and ensures Google can discover and index 100% of blog content.

Expected timeline:
- Week 1: Google discovers 134 new blog posts
- Week 2-4: Indexing of discovered content
- Month 2-3: Rankings improve for indexed pages
- Month 3-6: Sustained organic traffic growth
