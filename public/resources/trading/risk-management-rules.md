# RISK MANAGEMENT RULES - THE 10 COMMANDMENTS

## 1. THE 1% RULE ⚡
**Never risk more than 1% of your account on a single trade.**

Example:
- $10,000 account = Max $100 risk per trade
- $50,000 account = Max $500 risk per trade

Why? One bad day can't destroy you. You can lose 20 trades in a row and still be in the game.

---

## 2. POSITION SIZING IS EVERYTHING 📊
**Calculate exact position size BEFORE every trade.**

Formula:
```
Position Size = (Account × Risk%) ÷ (Entry - Stop Loss)
```

Use the Position Size Calculator tool - never guess!

---

## 3. STOP LOSS IS NON-NEGOTIABLE 🛑
**Every trade MUST have a stop loss set before entry.**

- Set it based on chart structure, not arbitrary numbers
- Never move stop loss farther from entry
- Honor your stop - no "just a little more" excuses

---

## 4. MINIMUM 2:1 RISK/REWARD 🎯
**If your profit target isn't at least 2x your risk, skip the trade.**

Why? With 2:1 R/R, you only need 33% win rate to be profitable.

Example:
- Risk: $100
- Reward: $200 minimum
- Better: $300+ (3:1 or higher)

---

## 5. NO REVENGE TRADING 🚫
**Lost a trade? Take a break. Don't try to "get it back."**

Rules:
- After 2 losses in a row → Stop for the day
- After 3 losses in a week → Review your strategy
- Emotions high? Close trading platform

---

## 6. MAX DAILY LOSS LIMIT 📉
**Set a maximum dollar amount you're willing to lose per day.**

Example:
- $50K account × 2% = $1,000 max daily loss
- Hit $1,000 down? STOP TRADING

This prevents catastrophic days from wiping you out.

---

## 7. TRADE YOUR PLAN, NOT YOUR EMOTIONS 🧠
**Have a written trading plan. Follow it.**

Your plan should include:
- Entry criteria
- Exit criteria  
- Position sizing rules
- Trading hours
- Markets to trade
- Maximum daily trades

If it's not in your plan, DON'T TRADE IT.

---

## 8. CONSISTENCY > HOME RUNS 🎪
**Aim for consistent small wins, not lottery tickets.**

Better:
- 60% win rate, $200 avg win, $100 avg loss
- Profit Factor: 3.0

Than:
- 20% win rate hoping for 10:1 trades
- Profit Factor: 0.5 (losing money)

---

## 9. SCALE UP SLOWLY 📈
**Increase position size only after proving consistency.**

Requirements to scale up:
- ✓ 30+ trades documented
- ✓ Profit Factor > 1.5
- ✓ Win Rate > 50%
- ✓ Following all rules

Then increase by 0.25% increments (1% → 1.25% → 1.5%)

---

## 10. PROTECT YOUR PROFITS 💰
**Once up for the day, reduce risk.**

Example:
- Started with $50,000
- Up $500 for the day
- Now risk only 0.5% instead of 1%

Lock in gains. Don't give back your hard-earned profits.

**REMINDER:** The goal isn't to win every trade. The goal is to survive and be profitable over time. Risk management is what separates professionals from gamblers.

**Print this. Put it on your wall. Read it before every trading session.**
