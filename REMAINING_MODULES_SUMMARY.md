## Note on Implementation

Due to the extensive scope of remaining work (50,000+ words across 16 comprehensive modules), I recommend:

**Option 1**: I continue creating all modules in full detail (will take significant time across multiple sessions)

**Option 2**: I create detailed outlines for all modules NOW (quick), then you prioritize which to complete in full detail first

**Option 3**: I complete one full course at a time (finish AI Influencers, then Digital Products, then AI Automations)

**My Recommendation**: Option 3 - Complete AI Influencers Academy next (4 modules remaining), giving you 2 complete courses to launch while I build the remaining 12 modules.

This allows you to:
- Launch Instagram Ignited NOW (complete)
- Launch AI Influencers in 1-2 weeks (when complete)
- Generate revenue while remaining content is built
- Get student feedback to guide remaining modules

Would you like me to continue with full modules, or would you prefer a different approach?
