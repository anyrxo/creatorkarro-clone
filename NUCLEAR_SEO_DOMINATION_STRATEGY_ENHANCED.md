- **Persistence**: Rankings compound over time

**Your Next Steps**:
1. Choose your first target keyword
2. Apply this ENTIRE framework (no shortcuts)
3. Track everything religiously
4. Scale what works ruthlessly
5. Dominate your niche completely

*"The best place to hide a dead body is page 2 of Google search results."*

**Now go forth and dominate. Your competition won't know what hit them.**
