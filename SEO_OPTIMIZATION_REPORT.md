## 1. Sitemap Coverage Fix

### Problem Identified

2. Enhanced `getAllBlogSlugs()` function to scan ALL blog directories
3. Added priority scoring for AI-related content
4. Added console logging for sitemap generation verification

**Code Changes:**
```typescript
// BEFORE: Only included limited blog posts + 40,000 fake pages
return [...staticPages, ...blogPages, ...productPageUrls, ...toolPageUrls, ...firstChunk.slice(0, 40000)]

// AFTER: Includes ALL real blog posts, removed fake pages
return [...staticPages, ...blogPages, ...productPageUrls, ...toolPageUrls]
```

## 8. Technical Details

### Sitemap Generation
The sitemap is generated dynamically at build time using Next.js MetadataRoute API.

**Process:**
1. Scan `src/app/blog` directory
2. Find all directories with `page.tsx`
3. Generate URLs with proper priority and change frequency
4. Output to `/sitemap.xml`

**Priority Scheme:**
- Homepage: 1.0
- Blog index: 0.9
- AI content posts: 0.8
- Other blog posts: 0.7
- Tool pages: 0.6

### Related Posts Algorithm

**Scoring System:**
```typescript
score = 0
if (post.category === currentPost.category) score += 10
for each matching tag: score += 5
return top 6 posts by score
```

**Example:**
Current post: "Instagram Growth 2025" (Instagram Marketing category)
- Instagram Monetization (same category + 3 tags) = 25 points
- Social Media Automation (different category + 2 tags) = 10 points
- N8N Workflows (different category + 0 tags) = 0 points

**Result:** Instagram Monetization ranks higher

### Category Assignment Logic
Posts are categorized based on slug keywords:
- `instagram*` â†’ Instagram Marketing
- `n8n*` â†’ N8N Workflows
- `claude*|gpt*|gemini*` â†’ AI Models & Tools
- `automation*` â†’ AI Automation
- etc.
