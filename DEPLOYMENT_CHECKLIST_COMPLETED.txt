MONITORING RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

IMMEDIATE (0-1 hour):
[ ] Start API server: cd api && python market-data.py
[ ] Test health endpoint: curl http://localhost:5001/health
[ ] Test price endpoint: curl http://localhost:5001/api/price/EURUSD
[ ] Test analysis endpoint: curl http://localhost:5001/api/analysis/EURUSD
[ ] Monitor console for errors/warnings
[ ] Check API response times (<2s expected)

SHORT-TERM (1-24 hours):
[ ] Monitor API error rate (target: <1%)
[ ] Check response times under load
[ ] Verify data accuracy (spot check market data)
[ ] Monitor memory usage (expect reduction with Pandas 2.x)
[ ] Check error logs for deprecation warnings
[ ] Test all 5 API endpoints thoroughly

MEDIUM-TERM (1-7 days):
[ ] Benchmark performance improvements
[ ] Validate technical indicators (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands)
[ ] Monitor for pip 25.3 release
[ ] Re-run security scan weekly
[ ] Check frontend integration (CORS)

LONG-TERM (1-4 weeks):
[ ] Upgrade pip to 25.3 when available
[ ] Performance comparison (before/after metrics)
[ ] Plan Flask 3.2 migration (deprecation warning)
[ ] Establish monthly security update schedule
