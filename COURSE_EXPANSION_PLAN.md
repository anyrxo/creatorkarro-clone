# 🚀 Course Expansion & Creator Studio Plan

## 🎯 Objective
Transform the platform into a "Genius-Level" education hub by:
1. **Expanding Curriculum**: Adding depth, advanced tactics, and better flow to all 4 courses.
2. **Empowering the Creator**: Building an **Admin Creator Studio** that provides video scripts, slide outlines, and tool integration cues for every single lesson.
3. **Enhancing Resources**: Matching new content with high-value templates, PDFs, and tools.

## 🛠️ NEW FEATURE: Admin Creator Studio
**Problem**: Creating high-quality course videos is hard. You need to know what to say, what to show, and when to mention the tools.
**Solution**: A dedicated "Creator Mode" in the Admin Dashboard.

### **Features:**
- **Slide Outline Generator**: For every lesson, see exactly what should be on the slides (Title, Bullets, Visuals).
- **Teleprompter Script**: A verbatim or bulleted script to read while recording.
- **Tool Cues**: Visual indicators in the script saying *"👉 PAUSE: Open the [Tool Name] and demonstrate X"* to drive usage of the interactive tools we built.
- **Resource Prompts**: Reminders to mention specific PDFs/Downloads available in that lesson.
